    "text": "UK’s budget is a bet that inflation is transitory and is designed in keeping Tories in power.\n\n\n\n\nBudget Day today, besides my congratulations to my ex-colleagues for making the hard work in the background, a few quick reactions.\nToday’s Budget was an off the shelf, “Play it Safe” Sunak’s Budget: nothing too negative, nothing too positive. Balance the political and economic risks in the short-run, reduce debt - mostly after the planned elections in two years - and make sure it meets OBR’s forecasts on paper (i.e. its forecasts) than in reality.\nMinimal to nothing to support long-term growth, that is potential output, which has a deflationary impact over time and hence helps people get cheaper mortgages. To be fair, no political party has a serious structural reform agenda.\nAlso, the distributional implications will be subject to debate. According to OBR, in just two years, inflation wiped out 8 years of real wage growth for most households in the UK. After the budget, most of the vulnerable will still see real wages falling.\nThe overall fiscal stance is mostly tuned to the expected peak in inflation, pushing back the actual austerity after the elections. In general, how to tackle inflation through fiscal policy is not easy, but blind austerity is also not the answer (I will try to come back with a more detailed post in due time). Key point is that fiscal policy is much more likely to have a much higher impact on output than reduce inflation via aggregate demand. Letting BoE lead in the fight over inflation and doing the minimum by not adding fuel to the fire makes some sense. The Budget delivers such ideas.\nHunt also mentioned that inflation is mostly driven by global factors. Although this is correct, I think this rather exposes the government than can be used as an excuse. The Labor party never seized the opportunity to attack this statement by pointing out that price caps is a good defense against global shocks. The Americans after all did it quite successfully in response to the post-war commodity price pressures and the Spanish Flu.\nWhy is price caps an optimal response to rising inflation due to global factors? Besides the obvious protection to households, energy price caps are equivalent to closing the borders to the widespread global virus. Price caps effectively a) convert a supply side problem to a demand problem and b) increase the relative importance of domestic to global factors. Together this implies that the national governments and central banks can have a greater control over inflation and thus contribute to a less uncertain outlook.\nPrice caps came quite late and with no clear plan on what is next beyond that seem to be conditioned on market expectations. Remember that when governments in the past had to manage similar inflation problems, inflation jumped once the price caps were lifted. Keeping inflation in a durable, and more importantly a more certain falling path, required price caps to be imposed much sooner with a much more clear plan, ideally linked to the overall risks in the global and domestic economy than accept the wishful thinking in the markets."

    "title": "Forward Guidance",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the world of central banking, few tools have gathered as much attention in recent years as forward guidance. Essentially, forward guidance involves the Federal Reserve (or “the Fed,” as it’s commonly known) communicating its future policy plans to the markets. By shaping expectations and influencing interest rates in this way, the Fed can steer the economy in the desired direction.\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, forward guidance became an especially critical tool, as the federal funds rate hit zero. In order to continue to stimulate the economy, the Fed needed to find new tricks or in the words of Bernanke ``we had to be creative”. Forward guidance allowed it to do just that. More recently, forward guidance has played an important role in the ongoing debate over inflation. In this post, I would be looking at a few stylized facts about how the Fed uses this tool.\nOne approach is to examine the “proxy rate” published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which allows us to gauge the Fed’s hawkishness over time. This proxy rate combines the policy rate with the interest rate effects of both balance sheet changes and direct communication. You can find more information on the proxy rate here and here. In essence, the proxy rate offers a way to compare the Fed’s actual policy rate to a hypothetical rate that reflects the total impact of the Fed’s actions (intentions) and statements on financial markets.\nI plot these two rates in Figure 1, where the discrepancy between them represents the interest rate equivalent of the forward guidance. It is worth noting that due to the forward guidance and the way monetary policy is conducted (i.e. usually first preparing the markets and then acting) the proxy rate leads the actual policy rate, and this pattern is especially pronounced post-2007.\nBefore the global financial crisis, the proxy rate and the fund rate were tightly correlated, until they started to diverge after 2007, when both QE and forward guidance became integral components of the monetary policy framework. During this period, the use of forward guidance amounted to a monetary policy stance of negative interest rates (the intention of QE and forward guidance). These ultra-low interest rates persisted until 2014, when the Fed reversed course.\nIn the more recent years, much of the analysis (including that of respected academics) has rushed to the conclusion that the Fed acted with a delay. However, as Figure 1 clearly shows, the Fed began to tighten financial conditions through forward guidance well before the interest rate hikes took place. According to the proxy rate, this tightening began around July 2021, a full eight months prior to the first rate hike in March 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: ?(caption)"

    "text": "Forward Guidance Since the Pandemic\nIt’s worth emphasizing that even prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the proxy rate and the fund rate were not identical. This discrepancy can be attributed to the inevitable measurement errors involved in calculating the proxy rate, as well as the potential impact of Fed officials’ speeches, which have historically revealed the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) intentions. Of course, it’s impossible to completely eliminate statistical errors. However, we can reasonably assume that most of the difference between the proxy rate and the fund rate can be attributed to communication-related factors.\nFigure 2 illustrates the difference between the proxy rate and the fund rate. It reveals the hypothetical level of interest rates that changes in the Fed’s balance sheet and the impact of direct communication have added or subtracted from the official policy rate. For instance, in this monetary policy tightening cycle, at its peak, forward guidance added an extra 3% to the policy rate. This implies that until last October, the economy has effectively functioning at a level of interest rates that is closer to the 6% than the official policy rate of 3%. It was only after Oct 2022 that the Fed turned less hawkish.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: ?(caption)"

    "text": "The Most Hawkish Fed in the US History\nIn conclusion, let me offer some final thoughts on forward guidance and explain why the Fed’s current stance is its most hawkish since the 1970s. Figure 3 below shows the per decade standardized distribution of the forward guidance measure - that is, the z-score of the distance between the proxy rate and fund rate. This metric allows us to compare the current stance with historical averages in a more consistent manner. A positive z-score signifies a hawkish stance, while a negative z-score indicates a dovish stance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Fed’s communication was more often dovish than hawkish - a situation that may have contributed to the runaway inflation of that period. This perception persisted into the next decade until Volcker changed it. Since 2000, when forward guidance became an integral part of the Fed’s policy framework, we have seen improved communication from the Fed and a symmetrical effect on markets.\nOver the past two years, the Fed has certainly taken a more hawkish approach to tackle inflation, as evidenced by its policy rate and the proxy rate. Despite some market commentary accusing the Fed of not doing enough, the latest evidence contradicts this misconception. In fact, as seen in Figure 4, the Fed’s hawkish tone has led to the largest hike in interest rates solely from its communication and balance sheet changes in the past half-century. What’s more, the current policy rate is expected to have a significantly greater impact on output than in previous years, and the pace of interest rate hikes is the fastest in history. This only leads to one conclusion: we’re currently witnessing the most hawkish monetary policy stance in modern US history, and its effects are just starting to emerge. It is not surprising then that the Fed have effectively turned into a less hawkish communication as early as last Oct 2022 as is indicated by the tunring point in the proxy rate.\n\n\n\n\n<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7ff5fecb4610>\n(a) ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\nFigure 4: ?(caption)"

    "text": "The war in Ukraine has raised significantly the odds of a recession in the near term, but also the likelihood to move into a new inflation regime as in the 70s. How real this risk is, depends on the key differentiating factors between now and then.\nIn a nutshell, textbooks would tell that a sequence of oil crises (rooted, like now, in geopolitical factors) permanently increased the cost of production for firms and, by extension, the cost of goods and services. This subsequently triggered a wage-price spiral (as households were trying to catch up with rising prices) which led to ever-increasing inflation. Such past experience places a material probability that a similar mechanism triggered by the same factors (oil shock and high inflation) might re-emerge with the Fed or all other major central banks unable to control inflation.\nA closer look, however, at the underlying factors that underpinned the mechanism behind this wage-price spiral would suggest that this time is different. In short, the structurally weaker bargaining power of workers and its dependency on the economic cycle is effectively putting an upper limit to any catch-up of wages with extreme inflation. The direct implication of this key differentiating factor alone is that a) any wage-price spiral is likely to be short-lived relative to the 70s, especially when growth would start to slow down and b) the cost-push shocks are unlikely to turn into permanent supply shocks as then.\nIn the rest of this post, I will mostly focus on discussing this argument in more detail, along with a few other, more known, key dissimilarities between then and now. In my mind, I have mostly the US economy, but some of the arguments are relevant to other countries, too.\n\n\nOne obvious difference between now and then, is that this wage-price spiral that unfolded during the 70s was heavily relying on the structurally strong bargaining power of workers that is absent today. Workers at the time were unionised and their bargaining power did not necessarily depend on the tightness of the labour market or the state of the economy as now. Currently, a recession or a slowdown in economic activity (either due to monetary policy tightening or a negative shock such as now with oil prices) is almost automatically reducing the bargaining power of most workers, and this in a fashion that nominal wages might not necessarily catch-up with inflation without legislation.\nAn exception here might be the high-income high-skilled households who nevertheless tend to consume less energy-intensive products (with declining overtime cost of production due to technological advancements) while their high marginal propensity to save diminishes the strength of aggregate demand on prices (formally flattening of the Philips Curve). This also highlights that in the absence of trade unions the degree of (wage or income) inequalities is another confounding factor that stops wages from catching up with inflation and implies that, on the aggregate, real wages most likely would fall. This effect in turn can help offset the (often reversible) production costs due to higher energy prices and help prevent the cost-push shocks to turn permanent.\nPut more simply, the structurally weaker bargaining position of workers in effect implies that any temporary cost-push shocks are less likely to manifest themselves into the permanent supply shock of the 70s, especially since oil is now a less important input to production compared to the past.\nNew modes of work arrangements and the ability of multinationals to either outsource or reallocate abroad (expensive) labour-intensive functions are two other factors that can reduce the persistence of cost-push shocks. For example, competition might force firms to contain their labour costs and among the available options they have is to offer indefinite work-from-home arrangements. This new mode of working could lift some of the pressure for workers to catch up with inflation when they are given the option to indefinitely move to less expensive regions. On the other hand, multinationals might choose to react more aggressively if they think their profitability is severely distressed. For example, they could choose to outsource some of their labour-intensive high-skill functions or reallocate their workers abroad. Given their size in the economy and the limited availability of quality jobs for high-skilled workers in advanced economies, this might further reduce the bargaining power of workers when economic growth slows down.\n\n\n\nSecondly, the world now is structurally very different from the 70s. We live in a world where the global economy (perhaps for the first time in its history) is producing an excess amount of savings with record-low real investments. With governments around the world not really solving this problem, it is extremely unlikely to see any change in this structural issue in the foreseeable future. This dearth of investments contains, therefore, a very strong deflationary process that was totally absent during the 70s.\nThe forced coordination across countries in transitioning to net-zero or now the accidental coordination to increase defence spending (with little to no influence on r*, natural interest rate) is unlikely to outweigh the strong incentives to save from demographics, higher inequalities, structural weaker labour markets in combination with a weaker welfare state, and governmental or private market schemes, such as private pension schemes or other unfunded social security programs — that typically raise the incentives to save but at the cost of depressed returns on capital and higher financial risk, hence further reinforcing the incentive to save to reach target wealth levels by retirement which further depress returns and so on (“savings trap”). By now, we know by experience that in this world financial markets have a stronger incentive to keep most of the liquidity in the financial system (in search of yield) rather than finance real investments that depend on a very weak long-term growth outlook.\n\n\n\nThere are a few other more nuanced differentiating factors that are worth highlighting here. First, the degree of financialization together with the prevalence of idiosyncratic financial risks to households unveils other strong deflationary forces.\nFor households, is safe to assume that it is more challenging now to insure against the risk of employment, career and job displacement risks, health shocks etc. So, the most important insurance mechanism against bad outcomes is to build up buffers of savings and more wealth. Such a precautionary savings motive might be stronger today than in the past for a number of reasons:\n\nMuch weaker welfare states and employment protection that increase the severity of possible negative income shocks (which academic economists showed also explain the skewness of, much more uneven today, wealth distribution )\nMore leveraged households are extremely susceptible to negative wealth shocks mainly due to the housing market\nMore individualistic societies that make people rely more on their own feet than expect the help of others. Having money and building up wealth becomes then a high-order priority for most households to survive any adverse outcome or to increase their quality of life.\n\nSecond, the degree of financialization, as is captured by what economists might call market incompleteness, has increased since the 70s due to the liberalisation of capital flows and the availability of more hedging instruments. Now, the degree by which investors can hedge against risks is substantially greater today than before. In a world in which liquidity is abundant, this reinforces the incentives of the financial system to allocate more money into (risky) financial assets rather finance real investments (which as said before rely on a weak long-term growth outlook).\n\n\n\nAlthough this analysis is anything but comprehensive and the future is always uncertain, I highlighted here a few crucial differentiating factors that play a dominant role in most economies today and are important for the inflation regime. The deflationary forces from the structurally weaker labour force not only put an upper limit to the wage-price spiral (that is central to many peoples’ arguments for inflation to go out of hand) but also limit the extent by which a cost-push shock can turn into a permanent supply shock. This, together with the legacies from the “excess savings world”, unleashes a strong deflationary process that can only be reversed by either a serious escalation in the war in Ukraine (a largely unpredictable factor) or by some serious policy mistake from now on.\nAll these suggest that the Fed can still control inflation, albeit at the cost of a recession or slow economic growth in the near term. In addition, the structural characteristics in the labour markets also imply that the deflationary process might be asymmetric and less synchronised across countries (i.e. the opposite case with the existing inflation dynamics).\nFor Eurozone countries, which also inherit other critical similarities with the 70s such as the “fixed exchange rate” regime, rising public debt, and current account imbalances, as well as, feature higher sensitivity to oil prices, inflation might become a source of a new political conflict due to ECB’s hawkish turn. This adds a greater uncertainty in Eurozone countries around the long-term inflation outlook and does not rule out the possibility that some countries might indeed experience relatively long stagflation given the ECB’s asymmetric (recessionary) implications and their different structural characteristics, and the imperfect political and fiscal union."
