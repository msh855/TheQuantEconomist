    "title": "Fed’s Forward Guidance",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Over the past two years, the Federal Reserve has been criticized by a wide range of actors, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), financial markets, top academic economists, and even its own top officials, for being too slow to act on inflation and maintaining a monetary policy stance that is too loose given record high inflation. However, many of these arguments still rely on backward-looking measures, such as the distance of the policy rate from neutral, as well as on “old-school” thinking that implicitly ignores how much of an impact forward guidance can have.\n\n\n\n\nIn this post, I present a few key facts about how the Federal Reserve has used forward guidance in recent decades. I also discuss how the Fed’s credibility has added a record-high degree of extra tightening, which began much sooner than is publicly discussed or acknowledged.\n\n\n\n\nIn the world of central banking, there are few policies that have been as widely discussed in recent years as forward guidance and balance sheet changes. These policy tools, known as non-conventional policies, define the broader monetary policy stance that goes beyond just setting the policy rate. For example, forward guidance is a method used by central banks to directly communicate or signal their intentions in order to shape expectations and influence interest rates in the desired direction. During the 2008 financial crisis, forward guidance and Quantitative Easing (QE) became especially critical tools, as the policy rate hit zero. In order to continue stimulating the economy, the Federal Reserve (Fed) needed to find new ways to do so. As Ben Bernanke put it, “we had to be creative.” Forward guidance allowed the Fed to do just that. More recently, forward guidance has played an important role in the ongoing debate over inflation. In this post, I will be looking at a few stylized facts about how the Fed uses this tool.\n\n\n\nOne way to measure the Fed’s unconventional policies is to look at the “proxy rate”, which is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (See here and here). The proxy rate combines the Fed’s policy rate with the level of interest rate implied by the balance sheet changes and direct communication. Hence it incorporates the hypothetical interest rate that associates with the unconventional components of monetary policy.\nI have plotted the proxy and policy rate in Figure 1 below. The proxy rate leads the actual policy rate because of the way monetary policy is implemented. Typically, the markets are set up in anticipation of a change in the policy rate before the change actually takes place. This pattern is (unsurprisingly) pronounced after 2007.\nBefore the global financial crisis, the proxy rate and the fund rate were closely correlated. However, they started to diverge after 2007, when quantitative easing (QE) and forward guidance became integral components of the monetary policy framework. During this period, the use of forward guidance amounted to a monetary policy stance of negative interest rates (validating the purpose that it was designed). These ultra-low interest rates persisted until 2014 according to the proxy rate. At that point the Fed started tightening its policy until the pandemic hit.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Proxy and Policy Rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fed has been criticized (including by respected academics) for acting too slowly to address inflation, but the truth is that they began to tighten financial conditions well before the interest rate hikes. In fact, they started eight months before the first hike in March 2022, and almost a year and a half after the pandemic shock (Figure 1). This is important to note, because when the Fed changed course, inflation was mostly driven by supply-side factors, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. This left less room for monetary policy to do much. However, the Fed clearly began to change course before the pressure from the demand side on inflation started to substantially pick up.\nIt’s worth emphasizing that even prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the proxy rate and the fund rate were not identical. Part of this discrepancy can be attributed to the inevitable measurement errors involved in calculating a statistical measure such as the proxy rate. Of course, it’s impossible to completely eliminate statistical errors, but we can reasonably assume that most of the difference between the proxy rate and the fund rate can be attributed to communication-related factors.\nThis evidence makes it clear that the inclusion of forward guidance and other unconventional tools has expanded the criteria by which the monetary policy stance should be evaluated. It is now clear that the Fed has become looser than it appears when stimulating the economy, and tighter than the policy rate indicates when tightening. As a result, it is becoming more important to get a better sense of the magnitude of the non-conventional aspects of monetary policy. The following paragraphs will examine this issue more closely.\n\n\n\nThe difference between the proxy and policy rate shows the level of interest rate implied by the Fed’s forward guidance. Figure 2 shows exactly this. For example, at the peak of the proxy rate during this monetary policy tightening cycle, the Fed added an extra 3% to the policy rate by just pointing what will be doing. This means that until October 2022, the economy was effectively operating at an interest rate level closer to 6% than the official policy rate of 3%1. It was only after October 2022 that the proxy rate start coming off, signaling a less hawkish stance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Interest Rates equivalent of Direct Communication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFed’s tone shift was mostly evident in Jay Powell’s Jackson Hole speech last August who declared “the Federal Reserve must keep at it until the job is done”. The US stock market slid sharply after Powell spoke, with the benchmark S&P 500 index falling 3.4 per cent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3.9 per cent, recording the one biggest one-day decline for both indices (outside sudden crashes).\nTo put things in perspective, in Figure 3 I show the magnitude of this and other messages since 2020 and compare the unconventional part of the monetary policy to historical standards. The calculations are still based on the distance between the proxy rate and the policy rate. The left panel shows the average impact of communication-related factors across all tightening episodes since mid-70s as identified by the proxy rate. For the relevant periods, I have also filtered out the direct impact of balance sheet changes2. The right panel shows the distribution of the interest rates implied by forward guidance across each decades3.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Monetary Policy Tightening Cycles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Bernanke once said that “monetary policy is 99% words and 1% action.” This was certainly true in the current tightening cycle, where the Fed’s words had an unprecedented impact. The Fed’s communication and signaling factors added (on average) an additional 1.5 percent of interest rates hikes, which is three times more than the most aggressive Fed of the past.\nThe credibility factor also played a role here. Before gaining the “credibility medal” the Fed struggled to convince the markets in the first two tightening cycles in Figure 3, even though it raised rates significantly. Things changed with Paul Volcker, but it wasn’t until forward guidance became part of the monetary policy transmission mechanism that markets started taking the Fed seriously.\nAnother way to look at the impact of the Fed’s messaging in recent years is to look at the right panel of Figure 3, where I have plotted the distribution of the impact of forward guidance (in terms of interest rates). The Fed is now more likely to be seen as hawkish than dovish, given its seriousness in fighting inflation and the fact that markets still have faith in its words. This was not the case in the 1970s and 1980s. It is also worth noting that the formal incorporation of forward guidance has managed to have a relatively even impact across different economic conditions, indicating some ability to weigh the balance of risks and fine-tune its words to the situation.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, the Fed has carried out the swiftest policy rate increase in the history of the United States. As I have briefly discussed in a previous post, the present interest rate level suggests that the impact on output is likely to be just as significant. This implies that the response from the Fed’s end has been sufficiently forceful in all areas under its direct control. It’s hard not to draw the conclusion that we are presently experiencing the most hawkish monetary policy position in recent US history, and its repercussions are just beginning to materialize4.\nDoes this mean that a soft landing is off the table? That’s a whole other discussion. But the short answer is “No”. In fact, the opposite is true. According to this evidence, the Fed’s actions are what kept a soft landing on the cards. And, this shouldn’t be surprising. Technically, only the Fed needs to comply to a soft landing because of its mandate to balance maximum employment and price stability. Other central banks don’t have this restriction5.\nNevertheless, soft landing is still the holy grail of central banking. R. Dornbusch famously said, “No postwar recovery has died in bed of old age—the Federal Reserve has murdered every one of them”. The most notable (and technically the only) soft landing in the most recent 16 business cycles occurred in 1994 under Alan Greenspan. Inflation was rising rapidly in 1994, and Greenspan raised interest rates seven times in the space of a year, bringing them up to 6%. This was a significant increase, but it did not cause a recession. In fact, the economy continued to grow throughout 1994 and 1995. Why was it successful? Economists will pick three main reasons:\n\nFirst, the economy was strong at the time, which helped to cushion the impact of the higher interest rates.\nSecond, Greenspan was able to communicate his intentions clearly to the public, which helped to reduce uncertainty.\nThird, Greenspan was able to raise interest rates gradually, giving businesses and consumers time to adjust.\n\nIn Figure 4, I plotted this episode and compared it to the current tightening cycle. I also added the “Hard landing” of Volcker (which was essentially started by Burns and Miller) and the in-between tightening cycle of 1999 to make the case clearer. Before the 1980s, any comparisons are meaningless, as the Gold Standard was in place, there was a substantially different monetary policy framework, and fiscal dominance was the norm. I also ignored the tightening cycle that preceded the Global Financial Crisis (for obvious reasons) and the tightening cycle of 2018, as it was disrupted by the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Monetary Policy Tightening Cycles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fed’s reaction function under Greenspan and now is quite similar, including making up for Friedman’s “long and variable lags.” However, unlike in the past, the use of unconventional tools allows the Fed to adjust its policy more smoothly and early on, without raising the policy rate. The three conditions that made Greenspan a legend continue to hold in some reasonable sense. The dynamics are also similar to the tightening cycle of 1999, which ended with the dot-com crash. However, as the “mini” banking crisis clearly demonstrated, the financial system is much more resilient today. Of course, there are some factors that are different between now and then, such as the starting level of inflation.\nTo conclude, a soft landing is primarily a fine-tuning exercise that is difficult to achieve, almost identical if not as elusive as timing the market. Based on the evidence here, the Fed has taken all necessary steps to achieve this goal and some of the necessary conditions for a soft landing are clearly met. But I do think that, overall, luck factors are more important than they were in the past6."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nIt is sometimes surprising to hear Fed officials (such as James B. Bullard) support their arguments for the appropriate policy rate by referring to the Taylor rule, without considering the effects of direct communication, including the signals that their analysis sends to the markets. But it is even more surprising that analysts, journalists, and strategists often perpetuate the flaws in their thinking.↩︎\nTo filter out the direct impact of balance sheet changes, I controlled for the change in 10Y Treasuries. This may not completely capture the full impact, but it should be close. Only the first round of QE was strong enough. Subsequent rounds were less effective as markets anticipated the Fed’s actions. That is the reason why Bernanke wanted more QE to offset these effects and compensate for the tight fiscal policy at the time. A classic study is the one by Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen.↩︎\nFor readers not familiar with box plots see this post↩︎\nWe can discuss about the level of interest rates, but as I have explained in an earlier post I am very critical of the standard practice in using the distance of the policy rate relative to the neutral rates to indicate how neutral monetary policy is.↩︎\nAlthough, they still care about unemployment to avoid overshooting or undershooting inflation.↩︎\nI call “luck factors” the factors that central banks cannot fully control, such as consumer and business behavior. These behaviors are generally stable and predictable, but they can be disrupted by indirect or second-round effects of monetary policy. These indirect effects are what make the effects of monetary policy have “long and variable lags.” Supply shocks are also “luck factors” as are any other unanticipated shocks. In addition, a soft landing substantially depends on the pace at which central banks want to bring inflation down. A fast pace implies less chance of a soft landing, as it would require the real economy to be crashed. Too slow also reduces the chance of a soft landing, as there is a high chance that inflation expectations will become de-anchored and new unfavorable shocks will hit the system.↩︎"

    "title": "The Fed and Private Consumption (Wonkish)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The hawkishness of the Federal Reserve (Fed) is determined by how changes in interest rates affect consumer spending, which is the largest component of aggregate demand. The elasticity of intertemporal substitution is a forward-looking measure that can be used to assess the aggressiveness of monetary policy by capturing the sensitivity of private consumption to changes in interest rates. I show that the Fed’s recent projections imply a very tight monetary policy stance (tighter than the market expects) especially in the near term. However, the implied level of elasticity of intertemporal substitution is quite unusual compared to other empirical studies, suggesting that this may trigger strong income effects and inflation may not fall as quickly as the Fed is expecting. As a result, it appears that luck factors matter more for inflation dynamics, as neither the supply-side factors nor the indirect effects of higher interest rates (which appear more relevant empirically) are under the Fed’s direct control.\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral banks have begun their tightening cycle to bring an exceptionally high inflation rate down, and are committed to even more tightening if inflation remains high. In assessing the tightness of monetary policy, it is common to compare the policy rate (the rate at which banks lend to each other) to the size of inflation or the level of neutral interest rates, and to compare this distance across time. However, this approach does not tell us much about the expected drop in aggregate demand.\nMore importantly, comparisons across time are not very meaningful. For example, a 50 basis point increase in the policy rate might have a stronger impact today than it did 20-30 years ago, because a much larger number of people are now leveraged. Therefore, even if the distance between the policy rate and inflation looks larger (or smaller) between two different periods, such comparisons are inconsistent due to differences in the prevailing structure of the economy.\nhe Federal Reserve’s ability to control inflation is closely linked to how interest rates affect consumer spending. This is because consumer spending accounts for roughly 60% of aggregate demand, which is equivalent to GDP. Therefore, a supplementary (and perhaps more appropriate) way to assess the tightness of monetary policy is to look at the effects of interest rates on private consumption.\nThe short-term nominal interest rates, which are the Federal Reserve’s main tool for affecting aggregate demand, transmit to private consumption in two broad ways. The first is through a direct channel, which takes into account how interest rates alone affect consumption. The second is through an indirect channel, which only focuses on the second-order effects of interest rate changes on aggregate demand, namely the change in disposable income of households. It is important to note that the indirect effects emanate from the direct impact of the original interest rate change and are therefore a function of consumers’ response to rising interest rates.\nIn evaluating the right monetary policy stance, it is necessary to make judgments on two interdependent issues:\n\nHow the direct effects would affect consumption.\nWhether the transmission mechanism of monetary policy relies more on the direct or indirect channel.\n\nInappropriate judgments on the first issue would necessarily lead to misleading or fallacious judgments on the second. While the first issue may seem less controversial, the quantitative impact of monetary policy on private consumption is still ambiguous.\nIn this post, I will focus on the first issue. Clarifying this issue can help to bring more clarity when assessing monetary policy tightness. For example, if the direct effects are expected to be sufficiently strong, the fall in disposable income will contribute less to the drop in aggregate demand. Otherwise, the potential reliance on the indirect effects implies a more persistent inflation and uncertain outlook, and adds to the factors that the Federal Reserve needs to overcome, since such second-order effects are (together with the supply side factors) not under its direct control.\n\n\n\nThe effects of interest rates on consumption are a central part of macroeconomic theory. When interest rates rise, there are two main effects:\n\nThe substitution effect: Higher interest rates make it more expensive to consume now, so people tend to save more and consume less.\nThe income effect:: Higher interest rates also increase the income that people earn from their savings, which can lead to increased consumption.\n\nThe overall effect of interest rates on consumption is ambiguous, and depends on the relative strength of the substitution and income effects. In general, the substitution effect is stronger for people who have lower incomes and less wealth, while the income effect is stronger for people who have higher incomes and more wealth.\nThe conventional view is that (on aggregate) higher interest rates reduce consumption, as the substitution effect outweighs the income effect. However, the size of the effect is uncertain, and depends on the distribution of income and wealth in the economy.\nOne way to measure the relative strength of the substitution and income effects is to look at the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS). The EIS is a measure of how responsive people are to changes in interest rates. A higher EIS means that people are more likely to save when interest rates rise, and consume less.\nIn the next section, I estimate the EIS based on the Fed’s forecasts. This will allow me to extract the implicit judgement that the Fed is making about the effects of interest rates on consumption.\n\n\n\nTo this end, I will use a conventional macroeconomic approach. This may not allow definite conclusions, but it works well as a proof of concept. Assuming that households are reasonably forward-looking, conventional macroeconomic theory likes to use the so-called Euler equation to study consumption dynamics. People may also be familiar with this equation through the CAMP model, which is used to study the relationship between business cycles and asset prices.\nThere are various versions of this equation, depending on the application. For the point I want to make here, a conventional approach is sufficient. In this case, and in order to link inflation, interest rates, consumption, income, and substitution effects, I would assume that aggregate consumption follows the rule below (See here or here for a simple example)\n\\[\nE_{t} \\Delta \\overline{ c_{t+1}}=\\sigma \\widehat{r_{t}}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\Delta \\overline{ c_{t+1}} = \\log(c_{t+1})-\\log(c_{t}) \\quad (\\text{real consumption growth})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\widehat{r_{t}} = \\log(r_{t})-\\log(r^*)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{and} \\quad r_{t} = i_{t}-\\pi_{t+1} \\quad ( \\text{real risk-free/fund rate with } r^* \\equiv \\text{long-run values})\n\\]\nThe parameter \\(\\sigma\\) is the so-called elasticity of intertemporal substitution, which controls the sensitivity of consumption growth to changes in interest rates1. The higher this value, the more sensitive consumption growth is to a change in interest rates. This parameter also controls the balance between the substitution and income effects. More specifically:\n\\[\n\\sigma\n\\begin{cases}\n&lt; 1 \\qquad \\text{Income Effect &gt; Substitution Effect} \\\\\n&gt; 1 \\qquad \\text{Income Effect &lt; Substitution Effect} \\\\\n= 1 \\qquad \\text{Income Effect = Substitution Effect}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nAn estimate of less than one implies that the income effect dominates the substitution effect and consumption tends to increase after an increase in interest rates. Conversely, when the substitution effect is greater than the income effect (\\(\\sigma &gt; 1\\)), higher interest rates encourage more savings and less borrowing, hence aggregate demand falls. There is also the third case where these two effects cancel each other out, so consumption is insensitive to interest rates. This is irrelevant in the short run, but not implausible in the long run.\nNote that the natural interest rate is a function of \\(\\sigma\\), which captures households’ desire to smooth consumption over time. For example, if consumers permanently change their consumption preferences (e.g. becoming more stingy) this affects the path of consumption and, by extension, the supply of savings, which is important for natural interest rates.\nIn the June statement, the Fed released the following projections:\n\n\n\nVariable\n2022\n2023\n2024\nLong-run\n\n\n\n\nreal GDP growth\n1.7\n1.7\n1.9\n1.8\n\n\nPCE Inflation\n5.2\n2.6\n2.2\n2\n\n\nFederal funds rate\n3.4\n3.4\n3.4\n2.5\n\n\n\nI use these projections to reverse engineer and uncover the parameter \\(\\sigma\\) based on the consumption rule above. As the Federal Reserve does not publish its projections for real consumption growth, I will use real GDP growth instead. In the data, real GDP growth and real consumption growth are strongly correlated (the correlation coefficient is roughly 0.90–0.99), so this approximation does little harm. Therefore, such forecasts imply that the EIS is:\n\n\n\n\n2022\n2023\n2024\n\n\n\n\nCentral Scenario\nN/A\n4.5\n5\n\n\n\nFor the year 2022, it was not possible to estimate \\(\\sigma\\), since mathematically, the interest rates were too low for the size of inflation, and therefore the logarithm was not defined. In general, the Fed’s central forecasts imply a rather stable \\(\\sigma \\approx 5\\) across the forecast years. Interestingly, this in turn implies that the Fed may need to raise interest rates by another 200 basis points by the end of 2022 in order to validate its assumption.\nThis evidence suggests that a) the Fed may be assuming that substitution effects outweigh income effects on the aggregate2, which is in line with conventional wisdom, but also that markets might underestimate the probability of higher interest rates in the future.\n\n\n\nHowever, in the current context, the strength of the substitution effects, that is, the size of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS), also matters for the tightness of monetary policy. To get a sense of this, I used an excellent meta-analysis that collects more than 2,700 published estimates of the EIS across countries, with about half of them focusing on the United States. Based on this study, I show below the distribution of the EIS across countries, including the US. The red horizontal line is when the EIS equals 1, so values above this line indicate when the substitution effect dominates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe good news is that the Fed’s forecasts suggest that monetary policy is quite tight (more than the market assumes). This is because the estimated value of the elasticity of substitution, \\(\\sigma\\), lies in the range of extreme values. For the size of the substitution effects assumed here, the rise in interest rates implies a rather strong impact on consumption in the near term.\nThe bad news is that the Fed is quite likely to be wrong. The most likely values of \\(\\sigma\\) (see Figure) suggest that the income effect typically dominates. This means that consumption could still drop, but not as much as the Fed might be expecting. This is because the rich are likely to hold consumption firm, even if interest rates rise. Relative to the case where the substitution effects dominate, consumption takes a smaller hit in this case, but it takes a longer time to recover.\nThe ugly part is that central banks, including the Fed, have traditionally focused on aggregate outcomes. This was partly due to data limitations, as it was hard to identify distributional effects without large individual-level panels. But it also reflected the conventional view that monetary policy works largely through intertemporal substitution, which was thought to affect everyone in much the same way. Nevertheless, recent recent research is convincingly suggesting that monetary policy works largely through indirect effects. As I noted, income effects are likely to be empirically more relevant than the Fed might be assuming.\nSo, even if the aggregate effects of monetary policy are probably about as large as we want, it now appears that monetary policy works largely through redistribution. For that reason, it is questionable whether the Fed would insist on any excessive tightening for too long.\n\n\n\nMy previous post did not aim to provide a comprehensive analysis. To simplify matters, I only focused on consumption-saving choices, taking into account the desire of consumers to smooth consumption over time. However, at times of heightened uncertainty, households may develop another motive for saving: precautionary savings. This is a way of insuring themselves against uncertain labor market prospects. A precautionary savings motive combined with pessimistic sentiment also contributes to a falling aggregate demand. Therefore, even if the Fed gets it wrong with the intertemporal substitution, uncertainty is on its side. All it takes is to spread the fear of recession and aggregate demand (and oil prices) will fall.\nWealth effects, that is the drop in consumption due to the fall in asset prices, is another important channel that affects private consumption. I did not discuss this here either, but I expect that such effects are already incorporated in the Fed’s latest forecasts. In principle, one could use the same strategy that I developed here to uncover what the Fed is expecting, but the consumption rule might need to be changed to Epstein-Zin preferences.\nOverall, however, it appears that luck factors are more important for inflation dynamics. Neither the supply side factors nor the indirect effects are under the Fed’s direct control."

    "text": "The war in Ukraine has raised significantly the odds of a recession in the near term, but also the likelihood to move into a new inflation regime as in the 70s. How real this risk is, depends on the key differentiating factors between now and then.\nIn a nutshell, textbooks would tell that a sequence of oil crises (rooted, like now, in geopolitical factors) permanently increased the cost of production for firms and, by extension, the cost of goods and services. This subsequently triggered a wage-price spiral (as households were trying to catch up with rising prices) which led to ever-increasing inflation. Such past experience places a material probability that a similar mechanism triggered by the same factors (oil shock and high inflation) might re-emerge with the Fed or all other major central banks unable to control inflation.\nA closer look, however, at the underlying factors that underpinned the mechanism behind this wage-price spiral would suggest that this time is different. In short, the structurally weaker bargaining power of workers and its dependency on the economic cycle is effectively putting an upper limit to any catch-up of wages with extreme inflation. The direct implication of this key differentiating factor alone is that a) any wage-price spiral is likely to be short-lived relative to the 70s, especially when growth would start to slow down and b) the cost-push shocks are unlikely to turn into permanent supply shocks as then.\nIn the rest of this post, I will mostly focus on discussing this argument in more detail, along with a few other, more known, key dissimilarities between then and now. In my mind, I have mostly the US economy, but some of the arguments are relevant to other countries, too.\n\n\nOne obvious difference between now and then, is that this wage-price spiral that unfolded during the 70s was heavily relying on the structurally strong bargaining power of workers that is absent today. Workers at the time were unionised and their bargaining power did not necessarily depend on the tightness of the labour market or the state of the economy as now. Currently, a recession or a slowdown in economic activity (either due to monetary policy tightening or a negative shock such as now with oil prices) is almost automatically reducing the bargaining power of most workers, and this in a fashion that nominal wages might not necessarily catch-up with inflation without legislation.\nAn exception here might be the high-income high-skilled households who nevertheless tend to consume less energy-intensive products (with declining overtime cost of production due to technological advancements) while their high marginal propensity to save diminishes the strength of aggregate demand on prices (formally flattening of the Philips Curve). This also highlights that in the absence of trade unions the degree of (wage or income) inequalities is another confounding factor that stops wages from catching up with inflation and implies that, on the aggregate, real wages most likely would fall. This effect in turn can help offset the (often reversible) production costs due to higher energy prices and help prevent the cost-push shocks to turn permanent.\nPut more simply, the structurally weaker bargaining position of workers in effect implies that any temporary cost-push shocks are less likely to manifest themselves into the permanent supply shock of the 70s, especially since oil is now a less important input to production compared to the past.\nNew modes of work arrangements and the ability of multinationals to either outsource or reallocate abroad (expensive) labour-intensive functions are two other factors that can reduce the persistence of cost-push shocks. For example, competition might force firms to contain their labour costs and among the available options they have is to offer indefinite work-from-home arrangements. This new mode of working could lift some of the pressure for workers to catch up with inflation when they are given the option to indefinitely move to less expensive regions. On the other hand, multinationals might choose to react more aggressively if they think their profitability is severely distressed. For example, they could choose to outsource some of their labour-intensive high-skill functions or reallocate their workers abroad. Given their size in the economy and the limited availability of quality jobs for high-skilled workers in advanced economies, this might further reduce the bargaining power of workers when economic growth slows down.\n\n\n\nSecondly, the world now is structurally very different from the 70s. We live in a world where the global economy (perhaps for the first time in its history) is producing an excess amount of savings with record-low real investments. With governments around the world not really solving this problem, it is extremely unlikely to see any change in this structural issue in the foreseeable future. This dearth of investments contains, therefore, a very strong deflationary process that was totally absent during the 70s.\nThe forced coordination across countries to transition to net-zero, or the accidental coordination to increase defence spending (which has little to no influence on \\(r^{*}\\), the natural interest rate), is unlikely to outweigh the strong incentives to save that come from demographics, higher inequalities, structural weaknesses in labour markets combined with a weaker welfare state, and government or private market schemes, such as private pension schemes or other unfunded social security programs. These schemes typically raise the incentives to save, but at the cost of depressed returns on capital and higher financial risk. This further reinforces the incentive to save to reach target wealth levels by retirement, which in turn further depresses returns, and so on (a “savings trap”). We now know from experience that in this world, financial markets have a stronger incentive to keep most of the liquidity in the financial system (in search of yield) rather than finance real investments that depend on a very weak long-term growth outlook.\n\n\n\nThere are a few other more nuanced differentiating factors that are worth highlighting here. First, the degree of financialization together with the prevalence of idiosyncratic financial risks to households unveils other strong deflationary forces.\nFor households, is safe to assume that it is more challenging now to insure against the risk of employment, career and job displacement risks, health shocks etc. So, the most important insurance mechanism against bad outcomes is to build up buffers of savings and more wealth. Such a (structural) precautionary savings motive might be stronger today than in the past for a number of reasons:\n\nMuch weaker welfare states and employment protection that increase the severity of possible negative income shocks (which academic economists showed also explain the skewness of, much more uneven today, wealth distribution )\nMore leveraged households are extremely susceptible to negative wealth shocks mainly due to the housing market\nMore individualistic societies that make people rely more on their own feet than expect the help of others.

    "text": "One obvious difference between now and then, is that this wage-price spiral that unfolded during the 70s was heavily relying on the structurally strong bargaining power of workers that is absent today. Workers at the time were unionised and their bargaining power did not necessarily depend on the tightness of the labour market or the state of the economy as now. Currently, a recession or a slowdown in economic activity (either due to monetary policy tightening or a negative shock such as now with oil prices) is almost automatically reducing the bargaining power of most workers, and this in a fashion that nominal wages might not necessarily catch-up with inflation without legislation.\nAn exception here might be the high-income high-skilled households who nevertheless tend to consume less energy-intensive products (with declining overtime cost of production due to technological advancements) while their high marginal propensity to save diminishes the strength of aggregate demand on prices (formally flattening of the Philips Curve). This also highlights that in the absence of trade unions the degree of (wage or income) inequalities is another confounding factor that stops wages from catching up with inflation and implies that, on the aggregate, real wages most likely would fall. This effect in turn can help offset the (often reversible) production costs due to higher energy prices and help prevent the cost-push shocks to turn permanent.\nPut more simply, the structurally weaker bargaining position of workers in effect implies that any temporary cost-push shocks are less likely to manifest themselves into the permanent supply shock of the 70s, especially since oil is now a less important input to production compared to the past.\nNew modes of work arrangements and the ability of multinationals to either outsource or reallocate abroad (expensive) labour-intensive functions are two other factors that can reduce the persistence of cost-push shocks. For example, competition might force firms to contain their labour costs and among the available options they have is to offer indefinite work-from-home arrangements. This new mode of working could lift some of the pressure for workers to catch up with inflation when they are given the option to indefinitely move to less expensive regions. On the other hand, multinationals might choose to react more aggressively if they think their profitability is severely distressed. For example, they could choose to outsource some of their labour-intensive high-skill functions or reallocate their workers abroad. Given their size in the economy and the limited availability of quality jobs for high-skilled workers in advanced economies, this might further reduce the bargaining power of workers when economic growth slows down."

    "text": "Secondly, the world now is structurally very different from the 70s. We live in a world where the global economy (perhaps for the first time in its history) is producing an excess amount of savings with record-low real investments. With governments around the world not really solving this problem, it is extremely unlikely to see any change in this structural issue in the foreseeable future. This dearth of investments contains, therefore, a very strong deflationary process that was totally absent during the 70s.\nThe forced coordination across countries to transition to net-zero, or the accidental coordination to increase defence spending (which has little to no influence on \\(r^{*}\\), the natural interest rate), is unlikely to outweigh the strong incentives to save that come from demographics, higher inequalities, structural weaknesses in labour markets combined with a weaker welfare state, and government or private market schemes, such as private pension schemes or other unfunded social security programs. These schemes typically raise the incentives to save, but at the cost of depressed returns on capital and higher financial risk. This further reinforces the incentive to save to reach target wealth levels by retirement, which in turn further depresses returns, and so on (a “savings trap”). We now know from experience that in this world, financial markets have a stronger incentive to keep most of the liquidity in the financial system (in search of yield) rather than finance real investments that depend on a very weak long-term growth outlook."

First, the degree of financialization together with the prevalence of idiosyncratic financial risks to households unveils other strong deflationary forces.\nFor households, is safe to assume that it is more challenging now to insure against the risk of employment, career and job displacement risks, health shocks etc. So, the most important insurance mechanism against bad outcomes is to build up buffers of savings and more wealth. Such a (structural) precautionary savings motive might be stronger today than in the past for a number of reasons:\n\nMuch weaker welfare states and employment protection that increase the severity of possible negative income shocks (which academic economists showed also explain the skewness of, much more uneven today, wealth distribution )\nMore leveraged households are extremely susceptible to negative wealth shocks mainly due to the housing market\nMore individualistic societies that make people rely more on their own feet than expect the help of others.

    "title": "Has inflation changed regime?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I demonstrate how to use a basic clustering algorithm to identify different inflation regimes over time. I compare the regimes for both headline and core US inflation. At the time of writing, core inflation did not change regime unlike headline inflation, which includes food and oil prices. This analysis suggests that supply-side factors might be driving inflation dynamics. Therefore, it is quite likely that in the near term core inflation might change regime too.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting about inflation is not an easy task. Definitely not now, where all you hear in the financial press is whether inflation is here to stay or is a matter of time to return to more normal levels. Investors, governments, and central bankers alike are trying to evaluate whether inflation is transitory or permanent. Investors care about this distinction to position their portfolios accordingly, governments to re-assess their budgetary policy, and central banks to evaluate their next move.\nThis article will go through a simple statistical analysis that aims to cluster inflation dynamics into different regimes using the Dynamic Time Wrapping approach — a basic time-series clustering method in machine learning (ML). This technique has been used to cluster different series, but in this article what I want to show how to use the very same approach to detect regimes across time. Another motivation for writing this article is to help promote use-cases of ML tools in macroeconomics.\nI will focus on the US and the CPI index and repeat the analysis with and without energy and food prices. I will first start with some basic exploration of the raw series, and then I will move on to the clustering exercise. I will use monthly data as I believe this gives a better sense of the inflation dynamics. The series are seasonally adjusted from the source (Fed St. Louis). The sample uses the latest available information (the series end Aug 2021 when I did it). The scope is to find similar to each other periods based on the underlying trend in inflation. From the economics point of view, the objective is to check which period in the past is the most similar to the current inflation dynamics. But instead of using human judgment would let the machine tell me.\n\n\n\nBut before I go to the analysis, I think it is good to briefly discuss the meaning of the terms “transitory” and “permanent” as I don’t feel that everybody is on the same page. It also helps to understand better the methodology taken here.\nMy gut feeling says that if you ask ten different people the meaning of transitory, is quite likely to hear eleven different answers. I remember a well-respected Chief Economist, who works for a top asset manager, saying that central banks will change the definition of transitory inflation to extend from a few months (say three) to a little longer (say nine months).\nOn this issue, I have noticed two types of people. Those who use the term transitory to refer to the duration of the cycle and those who use the term transitory to refer to the type of economic shock. These are not necessarily the same concepts. In this post, the use of transitory refers to the type of economic shock, which mostly relates to how people (markets) are behaving when they know or expect that a shock is temporary relative to when they know or expect the shock would alter things forever.\nFor example, when a government announces a tax hike lasting for a year this is unlikely to cool off demand much since is temporary in nature and people would not react much. In contrast, a tax reform that would last in the foreseeable future the effects on the economy would be quite strong. In some cases, like now with inflation, is not very easy to make such an assessment. Nevertheless, the indication from the bond markets and the reaction of gold (a traditional inflation hedge) indicate that this type of inflation shock resembles more a temporary economic shock. This is more obvious when looking at the bond markets, where the increase in interest rates relative to the size of inflation shock that we are experiencing is quite weak.\nMore generally, a transitory shock is expected to disappear after some point, as happens with business cycles like recessions. A typical business cycle may last up to 2 years, for example. Of course, from the practical point of view the duration of such a cycle matters. That’s a related, worth considering, type of question. But to keep things simple, I will not cover it here though you should know that transitory does not mean that is necessarily short-lived.\nAnother sloppy analysis that I noted is that sometimes people are mixing things up between inflation and price levels. A transitory inflation shock implies a permanent increase in price levels. Inflation is the growth rate of prices, so even if you have a one-off shock to the growth rate you get a permanent change in the levels. So, statements like “the recent rise in consumer prices will be transitory or more permanent” that I read in the news are not very meaningful.\nOn the other hand, a permanent shock is something that you expect to endure far ahead in the future. It is equivalent to a regime shift in other words. In this case that would mean a shift in the underlying inflation trend that depends on the fundamentals, like the natural rate of unemployment or the (de-)anchoring of the inflation expectations. Fundamentals also include the policy regime, that is preferences of governments and central banks about inflation. For a change in inflation regime, what really matters is the so-called π* (pi star), that is the rate of inflation that prevails when the economy is back to potential output or to use more jargon the rate of inflation consistent with the natural rate of unemployment. It is in this case that there is a serious chance that the inflation regime might change. The problem here is that π* is unobservable and so an ideal experiment would require estimating π*.\nTo proxy this case, however, in the analysis I have removed the cyclical component of the raw statistics and focused on the underlying trend. I did this using economists’ favorite HP filter. But you can apply any other filtering method you want or you think is more appropriate such as the Kalman Filter. Good data scientists usually smooth the raw series because they know is better for the time-series clustering algorithms. It also makes nicer interpretations when you are using time-series data. But here is the difference between “doing the right thing” vs “doing things right”.\nWhat my “ML research assistant” told me is that the regime for the core inflation (i.e. ex-food and energy prices) hasn’t changed. However, adding to this picture the food and energy sectors — which I like to think of them as representing the supply side of the economy — and we are back to the record high inflation regime of the 70s.\nCombining these signals, it looks that what matters is the supply-side factors. For example, do you believe that the semi-conductor shortages are going to be short-lived? Then it is a matter of time for supply to meet demand and be back to normal (maybe we need to be a bit more patient this time). On the other hand, do you believe that there is a significant re-organization on the supply side? Οr that a ship stuck in a Chinese port is re-shaping trading networks? Then we might already be in a new inflation regime similar to the one in the 70s, and so is a matter of time for the core inflation to change regime too. The more weight you put on the latter scenarios, the more likely is for the Fed to start thinking about raising interest rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore I go to the details of the results, I think is useful to go through a brief history of inflation. Figure 1 below shows how the inflation rate (annualized) evolved over the last 70 years. The blue and orange lines are rolling averages that remove the big cycles and the noise from monthly data to see the series better. The green and red lines are the underlying trends of the headline and core inflation, respectively.\n\n\n\nInflation Over time\n\n\nIn general, inflation has gone through two broad periods. The first one begins with the so-called Golden Age of Capitalism (roughly from the ’50s to early ’70s) and ends late ’70s to early ’80s. After crisis upon crisis (the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, oil crisis, a few political crises etc.), we then decided to bring a “better” version of capitalism where the only “serious” argument you hear is that now people have (a tiny) chance to get rich by exploiting opportunities that few can have. Political manifestos aside, the second broad phase for inflation begins in the early ’80s when inflation started declining and then stayed relatively low and stable until recently.\nSuppose now that you are an investor standing at the peak of the inflation rate in the late ’60s and then you saw this subsequent big dive in the early ’70s that seems to have lasted about two years. By the equivalent standards that many people currently think this decline in inflation rate might have signaled to you a permanent shock (fall) to inflation — after all two years of falling inflation ain’t enough permanent situation for you?\nYou might have already shorted gold, resisted investing in commodities, and so ended up losing a lot of money based on how history unfolded. We move forwards, and as we are approaching the end of that decade, inflation scores new highs. You now think that this time you have it right and repeat the same mistakes losing money again.\nYou start blaming Keynes for your miserable life because he taught you that everything was demand-driven, and so you were looking at the unemployment numbers. Later, you found some solace in some smart economists who agreed with you that Keynes was to blame on this occasion. These economists also picked up that you also got a little smarter by not looking too much at the past when you think about the future and taught new tricks to central banks and politicians — who by that time got a bitter divorce after a decade of remorse.\nHeartbroken central bankers found your new forward-looking thinking charming and made you a marriage proposal which you happily accepted. The agreement is that whatever central banks want to do will do and will tell you in advance (or at least close the eye), so your whims or mood would not destabilize the economy much. The fact that central banks stayed away from their ex- ( i.e. politicians) helped make the agreement credible and the marriage prosperous. Managing aggregate demand was never easier for central banks.\nSuch forward guidance and the anchoring of expectations contributed to creating a relatively stable environment where inflation was declining at a steady pace. In fact, between 1980–2007, things were so boring compared to the past that economists decided to call this period the “Great Moderation”. The Global Financial Crisis and the period that followed, except that ridiculed Nobel Prize winners and the intellectual originators of the Great Moderation, did not shake this relationship. Maybe it made the (modern version of) Philips curve more irrelevant and inflation expectations more dominant for stabilizing inflation, but no real drama.\nNow you are wondering, am I standing in the same peak where it all began? Effectively, what you are asking here is if the new “Bretton Woods” system, where everybody in the last few decades got used to the idea that inflation expectations remain anchored (within bands), would collapse. There is no answer to this question yet, but what the 70s taught us was that inflation expectations mattered (to be more specific the formation of inflation expectations) for the inflation regime during the 70s. Detecting in which inflation regime we are now, could signal how inflation expectation might develop.\n\n\n\nI told you before what signals I got from applying the basics of a basic ML tool. So, let me now show you the analysis. I will not write anything extensive here, beyond going through a few pictures and some talk. Perhaps not as entertaining as before.\nFigure 2 shows the different clusters (regimes) according to the DWT clustering technique (twisted for my purpose here). This basic analysis suggested that there are three regimes when looking at core inflation. For the record, I used the elbow method to determine the optimal clusters. One can also try other metrics like the Silhouette. For those not familiar, what this means is that I did not pick the number of regimes myself but let the machine suggest this to me. Each regime has its own color in Figure 2. The interesting bit is to check if the current regime has changed or not.\nAccording to the results, the machine it essentially says that there three inflation regimes: low-, medium, and high- inflation. Sounds quite sensible to me. But different to human judgments, here the basis for low, medium or high inflation are not determined by some arbitrary threshold which is what a more judgment based approach might do.\nGoing back to the analysis of the results, everything after 1990 (and before 1970) belongs to the same inflation regime (dark purple line). We have the case where core inflation was either trending upwards or downwards but with a few bumps (cycles) in between (green line). The third regime — the “outlier” — covers most of the stagflation era and its turning phase, which begins roughly at the time of the third oil shock in 1979 (yellow line).\n\n\n\nCore Inflation\n\n\nFor headline inflation, the machine again suggested three regimes. However, what has changed is that the current regime seems similar to the 70s (Figure 3, yellow line). The difference is that headline inflation includes the food and energy sectors. I am assuming that these sectors are good proxies in picking up the developments on the supply side. So, the current regime looks more like the early stages of stagflation. My “ML research assistant” seems to be reasonable1.\n\n\n\nHeadline Inflation\n\n\n\n\n\nAt face value, and in line with what many people are saying or what we already know, the supply side of the economy seems to be the differentiating factor here. And, supply factors aren’t easily controlled by central banks. I let you place your own judgment and make your own conclusions. Have already placed my quick thoughts before, but you can expand with yours. Keep also in mind that the analysis does not have the most up-to-date information of the last month (Sept 2021).\nThere is also more serious stuff that you can do, like model the switch in the inflation regime or think about the more serious scenario in which the Fed might lose control in managing inflation expectations. You might of course crunch your own ML clustering methods and extend them to understand the underlying factors that explain the differences in the regimes. Also, you can just simply repeat the same analysis by looking at different inflation metrics ( there are many ) and combining insights."

By the equivalent standards that many people currently think this decline in inflation rate might have signaled to you a permanent shock (fall) to inflation — after all two years of falling inflation ain’t enough permanent situation for you?\nYou might have already shorted gold, resisted investing in commodities, and so ended up losing a lot of money based on how history unfolded. We move forwards, and as we are approaching the end of that decade, inflation scores new highs. You now think that this time you have it right and repeat the same mistakes losing money again.\nYou start blaming Keynes for your miserable life because he taught you that everything was demand-driven, and so you were looking at the unemployment numbers. Later, you found some solace in some smart economists who agreed with you that Keynes was to blame on this occasion. These economists also picked up that you also got a little smarter by not looking too much at the past when you think about the future and taught new tricks to central banks and politicians — who by that time got a bitter divorce after a decade of remorse.\nHeartbroken central bankers found your new forward-looking thinking charming and made you a marriage proposal which you happily accepted. The agreement is that whatever central banks want to do will do and will tell you in advance (or at least close the eye), so your whims or mood would not destabilize the economy much. The fact that central banks stayed away from their ex- ( i.e. politicians) helped make the agreement credible and the marriage prosperous. Managing aggregate demand was never easier for central banks.\nSuch forward guidance and the anchoring of expectations contributed to creating a relatively stable environment where inflation was declining at a steady pace. In fact, between 1980–2007, things were so boring compared to the past that economists decided to call this period the “Great Moderation”. The Global Financial Crisis and the period that followed, except that ridiculed Nobel Prize winners and the intellectual originators of the Great Moderation, did not shake this relationship. Maybe it made the (modern version of) Philips curve more irrelevant and inflation expectations more dominant for stabilizing inflation, but no real drama.\nNow you are wondering, am I standing in the same peak where it all began? Effectively, what you are asking here is if the new “Bretton Woods” system, where everybody in the last few decades got used to the idea that inflation expectations remain anchored (within bands), would collapse. There is no answer to this question yet, but what the 70s taught us was that inflation expectations mattered (to be more specific the formation of inflation expectations) for the inflation regime during the 70s. Detecting in which inflation regime we are now, could signal how inflation expectation might develop."

    "text": "I told you before what signals I got from applying the basics of a basic ML tool. So, let me now show you the analysis. I will not write anything extensive here, beyond going through a few pictures and some talk. Perhaps not as entertaining as before.\nFigure 2 shows the different clusters (regimes) according to the DWT clustering technique (twisted for my purpose here). This basic analysis suggested that there are three regimes when looking at core inflation. For the record, I used the elbow method to determine the optimal clusters. One can also try other metrics like the Silhouette. For those not familiar, what this means is that I did not pick the number of regimes myself but let the machine suggest this to me. Each regime has its own color in Figure 2. The interesting bit is to check if the current regime has changed or not.\nAccording to the results, the machine it essentially says that there three inflation regimes: low-, medium, and high- inflation. Sounds quite sensible to me. But different to human judgments, here the basis for low, medium or high inflation are not determined by some arbitrary threshold which is what a more judgment based approach might do.\nGoing back to the analysis of the results, everything after 1990 (and before 1970) belongs to the same inflation regime (dark purple line). We have the case where core inflation was either trending upwards or downwards but with a few bumps (cycles) in between (green line). The third regime — the “outlier” — covers most of the stagflation era and its turning phase, which begins roughly at the time of the third oil shock in 1979 (yellow line).\n\n\n\nCore Inflation\n\n\nFor headline inflation, the machine again suggested three regimes. However, what has changed is that the current regime seems similar to the 70s (Figure 3, yellow line). The difference is that headline inflation includes the food and energy sectors. I am assuming that these sectors are good proxies in picking up the developments on the supply side. So, the current regime looks more like the early stages of stagflation. My “ML research assistant” seems to be reasonable1.\n\n\n\nHeadline Inflation"

    "text": "At face value, and in line with what many people are saying or what we already know, the supply side of the economy seems to be the differentiating factor here. And, supply factors aren’t easily controlled by central banks. I let you place your own judgment and make your own conclusions. Have already placed my quick thoughts before, but you can expand with yours. Keep also in mind that the analysis does not have the most up-to-date information of the last month (Sept 2021).\nThere is also more serious stuff that you can do, like model the switch in the inflation regime or think about the more serious scenario in which the Fed might lose control in managing inflation expectations. You might of course crunch your own ML clustering methods and extend them to understand the underlying factors that explain the differences in the regimes. Also, you can just simply repeat the same analysis by looking at different inflation metrics ( there are many ) and combining insights."

That is, if we begin from the “dark purple” regime in figure 3, the next possible regime is necessarily the “yellow” one where inflation would be trending upwards. So, one could then model the switch in the inflation regime through a Markov model.↩︎"
