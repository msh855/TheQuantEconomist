    "title": "Fiscal Policy for inclusive Growth",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Crafting Smarter Fiscal Policies\nIn today’s world, we often witness the divide between a growing economy and rising inequality. Economic growth, celebrated through increasing GDP and corporate profits, often stands in stark contrast to stagnating wages, limited upward mobility, and rising living costs for many. How do we reconcile this tension? Is it possible to foster robust growth while ensuring that prosperity is shared equitably across society? The answer lies in smarter fiscal policy design that aims to balance these two goals.\nGovernments worldwide face a crucial challenge: how to promote economic growth while reducing inequality. Achieving both objectives requires a thoughtful combination of policies that boost output, incentivize innovation, and ensure that the benefits of growth are distributed fairly. Below, I outline key strategies for crafting fiscal policies that enable us to navigate this trade-off.\n\n\nBalancing Progressive Taxation with Growth Incentives\nA well-designed progressive tax system is a powerful tool for reducing inequality without compromising growth. By ensuring that higher-income individuals contribute a larger share of their earnings while maintaining incentives for investment and innovation, governments can address wealth concentration effectively.\nTo strike this balance, tax credits for activities like research and development (R&D), education, and green technology investments can be provided to businesses. These incentives drive productivity, job creation, and sustainable economic expansion while reducing disparities in wealth.\n\nEconomic impact: Encouraging innovation and productive investments supports long-term growth.\nSocial impact: A progressive tax system helps redistribute income, reducing the wealth gap and funding social services that benefit lower- and middle-income groups.\n\n\n\nInvesting in Human Capital: Education as a Growth Engine\nEducation is one of the most potent equalizers. Governments can invest in human capital by providing accessible and high-quality education, vocational training, and lifelong learning opportunities. Ensuring that these resources are available to disadvantaged groups can create conditions for sustained economic success and social mobility.\nBy equipping people with the skills needed for modern economies, we foster innovation, increase productivity, and open doors to new industries. At the same time, investing in education directly tackles inequality, narrowing wage disparities and empowering individuals from all walks of life to improve their economic standing.\n\nEconomic impact: A more educated and skilled workforce boosts productivity, driving economic growth.\nSocial impact: Access to education promotes upward mobility and reduces income inequality over time.\n\n\n\nPublic Investment in Green Infrastructure\nPublic investment in infrastructure, particularly green and sustainable projects like renewable energy, eco-friendly transportation, and digital infrastructure, is essential for the future. These investments not only boost short-term demand and job creation but also prepare economies for the long-term transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future.\nGreen infrastructure investments create jobs, particularly for lower-skilled workers, and improve access to essential services, which helps reduce inequality. Moreover, infrastructure development reduces costs for businesses, enhances productivity, and fosters innovation—leading to both immediate and long-term economic benefits.\n\nEconomic impact: Infrastructure investment drives growth by improving efficiency and productivity.\nSocial impact: Green projects create jobs and improve access to services, helping marginalized communities.\n\n\n\nSupporting SMEs and Entrepreneurs\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are engines of job creation and innovation. Fiscal policies that support SMEs—through tax breaks, low-interest loans, and grants—can significantly contribute to economic growth, especially in underserved regions or sectors.\nSMEs tend to be more agile and are often the driving force behind technological advancement and job opportunities. By empowering SMEs, governments can reduce regional inequalities and provide opportunities for underrepresented entrepreneurs, fostering a more inclusive economy.\n\nEconomic impact: SMEs contribute to job creation, innovation, and local economic development.\nSocial impact: Supporting SMEs can reduce income and regional disparities by creating jobs in underserved communities.\n\n\n\nWealth and Capital Gains Taxation\nAnother key component of balancing growth and equity is the taxation of wealth and capital gains. Aligning capital gains tax rates more closely with income tax rates ensures that income from investments is treated fairly, and introducing or adjusting taxes on wealth or inheritances helps curb the concentration of wealth at the top.\nWealth and capital gains taxes can generate much-needed revenue for social programs and public investment without significantly discouraging productive investments. These measures target the wealthiest individuals and redistribute resources toward the broader population.\n\nEconomic impact: Carefully designed taxes on wealth and capital can raise revenue without hindering growth.\nSocial impact: These taxes help reduce wealth concentration, funding programs that benefit the entire society.\n\n\n\nSocial Transfers and Universal Basic Services\nTargeted social transfer programs, such as conditional cash transfers (CCTs), unemployment benefits, and pensions, provide critical support to low-income groups and reduce inequality. Social safety nets not only alleviate poverty but also increase consumption among lower-income households, stimulating demand and economic activity.\nBeyond income redistribution, Universal Basic Services (UBS)—free or subsidized healthcare, education, and childcare—ensure that everyone has access to essential services. This reduces the financial burden on low- and middle-income families, allowing them to focus on economic participation and upward mobility.\n\nEconomic impact: Social transfers increase disposable income for the most vulnerable, driving demand.\nSocial impact: These programs directly reduce poverty and inequality, providing access to basic services for all.\n\n\n\nConclusion: A Sustainable Path Forward\nThe notion that we must choose between economic growth and equity is a false dichotomy. By designing fiscal policies that promote both, we can create a society where prosperity is shared more broadly. Investing in human capital, supporting SMEs, taxing wealth fairly, and providing universal access to essential services all contribute to a more dynamic and just economy.\nThe key lies in careful, thoughtful policy design—one that balances incentives for innovation and investment with measures that ensure the benefits of growth are widely shared. When growth and fairness go hand in hand, we create a foundation for sustainable, resilient economic prosperity.\nWhat are your thoughts on how we can balance growth and equity? Let’s continue the conversation!"

    "text": "In the global economy, concepts like trade balance, exchange rates, and dollar invoicing play pivotal roles in shaping economic policies and outcomes. These dynamics are complex, yet understanding their interaction is key to navigating modern economic challenges—whether you’re an economist, policymaker, or simply curious about how these forces impact inflation, currency values, and trade.\nIn this post, we’ll dive into the interwoven relationships between these topics, breaking down the finer details to understand how they influence each other. We’ll also explore the broader policy implications, offering insights into how countries, especially those dependent on imports, can manage these dynamics effectively.\n\n\n\n\nThe balance of trade is one of the most fundamental concepts in international economics. It represents the difference between a country’s exports and imports of goods and services. A country with more exports than imports runs a trade surplus, while one with more imports than exports experiences a trade deficit.\nWhy is this important? The balance of trade not only reflects a country’s competitiveness in the global marketplace but also influences its currency value, foreign reserves, and economic growth.\n\n\n\nTrade Surplus: A country exporting more than it imports generally experiences a net inflow of foreign currency, increasing the value of its currency. This can be a sign of economic strength, but as we’ll explore later, an excessive or prolonged surplus can have its downsides.\nTrade Deficit: When a country imports more than it exports, it runs a trade deficit. While this may suggest an inflow of valuable goods or capital investments, persistent trade deficits can lead to currency depreciation, debt accumulation, and reliance on foreign financing.\n\nUnderstanding how trade balances affect broader economic factors—such as exchange rates and foreign investments—is essential for assessing the health of an economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the balance of trade typically brings to mind the exchange of goods—manufactured products, raw materials, and consumer goods—the balance of trade in services is equally critical, especially for advanced economies.\n\n\nThe trade balance in services refers to the difference between a country’s exports and imports of services such as financial services, tourism, information technology, and intellectual property. A positive balance (surplus) indicates the country is a net exporter of services, while a negative balance (deficit) indicates the opposite.\n\n\n\nThe service sector is often the backbone of modern economies. In countries like the U.S. and the U.K., services (including finance, IT, and professional services) account for a significant portion of economic activity and are key to maintaining employment and GDP growth.\nMoreover, service exports often compensate for deficits in the trade of goods, making them an important stabilizer for countries that import more than they export.\n\n\n\n\nUnited States: With its dominance in technology and financial services, the U.S. often runs a trade surplus in services, even though it experiences a deficit in goods.\nUnited Kingdom: The U.K. is a global financial hub, and its service exports (especially in banking and asset management) help offset other trade deficits.\n\nBy examining the balance of trade in services, we can gain insights into the health and competitiveness of a country’s key industries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some level of trade deficit can be normal, particularly for developing economies that are investing heavily in infrastructure or industries, persistent trade deficits carry significant risks. Here’s why:\n\nCurrency Depreciation: Over time, a trade deficit puts downward pressure on a country’s currency. As a country imports more, its currency becomes less valuable because of the high demand for foreign currencies. A weaker currency makes imports more expensive, leading to inflation, and can create a cycle of economic vulnerability.\nReliance on Foreign Capital: Countries running persistent trade deficits often need to finance them through foreign borrowing or selling off assets. This can lead to growing external debt, making the country increasingly reliant on foreign investors.\nLoss of Domestic Industries: A long-standing trade deficit might suggest that domestic industries are struggling to compete with foreign counterparts. Over time, this can erode local industries, leading to job losses and reduced innovation.\n\n\n\n\nWhile a trade surplus may seem like an inherently positive outcome, prolonged and large surpluses can also be harmful. Here’s why:\n\nCurrency Overvaluation: A prolonged trade surplus can lead to an overvalued currency, making a country’s exports less competitive over time. This can result in reduced export demand, especially in industries where price sensitivity is high.\nGlobal Imbalances: Large trade surpluses can contribute to global trade imbalances, where some countries accumulate large reserves while others experience deficits. This can create friction in international trade relations and lead to protectionist policies from trading partners who feel disadvantaged.\nEconomic Overdependence: A trade surplus often signals overreliance on certain industries or sectors (e.g., manufacturing in China or Germany). In the long run, this lack of diversification can be risky if demand for those industries wanes or if global market conditions change.\n\n\n\n\nThe key for any economy is to strike a balance between the two. While surpluses are useful for building reserves and stimulating export-driven growth, overly large surpluses or deficits create long-term vulnerabilities. Effective management of these trade flows can help stabilize the economy and maintain sustainable growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA country’s trade balance directly influences the demand for its currency. When a country exports goods or services, foreign buyers need to convert their currencies into the exporter’s currency, driving demand and increasing its value. A trade surplus usually leads to a stronger currency.\nConversely, if a country imports more than it exports (running a trade deficit), there is a greater demand for foreign currencies to pay for those imports. This puts downward pressure on the country’s currency, leading to depreciation.\n\n\n\nAs exchange rates fluctuate, they also impact the trade balance. For example:\n\nCurrency Depreciation: A weaker currency makes exports cheaper for foreign buyers, boosting export demand. At the same time, imports become more expensive, potentially reducing the volume of imported goods. This tends to improve the trade balance.\nCurrency Appreciation: A stronger currency has the opposite effect, making exports more expensive and imports cheaper, which can worsen the trade balance.\n\nThis dynamic creates a continuous feedback loop between exchange rates and trade balances, with each influencing the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn global trade, the U.S. dollar plays a unique role as the most widely used currency for international transactions. Whether it’s oil, electronics, or raw materials, many goods and services are invoiced in dollars regardless of where they’re produced or consumed.\nThis system of dollar invoicing weakens the immediate effect of exchange rate fluctuations on trade prices, creating both challenges and opportunities for countries.\n\n\n\n\nExporters: For countries that price their exports in dollars, fluctuations in their local currency don’t immediately affect foreign buyers. This reduces the traditional benefit of currency depreciation (which typically makes exports cheaper).\nImporters: Countries importing goods priced in dollars face higher costs when their currency depreciates against the dollar. This can lead to import-driven inflation, particularly in energy and commodity markets where pricing in dollars is common.\n\nFor the U.S., being the dominant issuer of the world’s invoicing currency offers unique advantages. Even when running trade deficits, the global demand for dollars keeps the currency relatively strong—a dynamic often called the “exorbitant privilege.”\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a world where trade balance, exchange rates, dollar invoicing, and inflation are deeply interconnected, traditional economic policies must be adapted to address modern challenges.\n\n\nCountries should focus less on exchange rate manipulation and more on inflation targeting. For those heavily dependent on USD-priced imports, maintaining exchange rate stability against the dollar is critical to controlling inflationary pressures.\n\n\n\nReducing reliance on imports, particularly for essential goods like energy or food, is key. Governments can promote domestic production by investing in infrastructure, offering tax incentives, and supporting innovation in key sectors.\n\n\n\nTo reduce exposure to dollar volatility, countries can pursue trade agreements that allow for local currency invoicing or use alternative currencies like the euro or yen. Bilateral currency swaps can also facilitate trade without relying on the dollar.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe delicate balance between trade deficits and surpluses requires constant attention and policy adjustment. Persistent imbalances, whether they are deficits or surpluses, can create vulnerabilities that affect not only domestic economies but also the global economy.\n\n\n\nFor countries dependent on USD-priced imports, maintaining exchange rate stability, diversifying trade currencies, and promoting domestic production are essential to managing trade deficits and inflation.\nFor the U.S., the challenge is balancing the benefits of dollar dominance with the responsibility to maintain global economic stability.\n\nUltimately, a multi-faceted approach involving monetary, fiscal, and trade policies is necessary to create resilient economies that can thrive in a rapidly evolving global landscape.\n\nThank you for reading!

    "title": "The Macroeconomic ‘Stars’",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn the vast universe of economics, certain guiding principles—“stars,” if you will—shape the paths policymakers take to navigate the global economy. These stars, marked by symbols like \\(r^*\\), \\(u^*\\), \\(\\pi^*\\), and \\(g^*\\), represent fundamental concepts that help governments and central banks steer economies toward stable growth and prosperity. Understanding these “stars” is essential for anyone interested in how economies function and how economic policies are shaped.\nBut what exactly are these stars, and why do they matter so much? Let’s take a closer look.\n\n\nThe Macroeconomic Stars and Why They Matter\nEconomists have their own set of stars that help them understand the underlying forces driving economies. These stars represent key variables such as interest rates, unemployment, inflation, and growth potential. Here are the four most crucial macroeconomic stars:\n\n\\(r^*\\): The Natural Rate of Interest\nThink of \\(r^*\\) as the economy’s “cruise control.” It’s the interest rate that keeps economic growth steady, neither speeding it up nor slowing it down.\nFactors affecting \\(r^*\\):\n\nTechnological innovation can raise \\(r^*\\) by boosting returns on investment.\nDemographic changes in aging populations, particularly in countries like Japan or parts of Europe, tend to lower \\(r^*\\).\nGlobal capital flows, such as a global savings glut, can depress \\(r^*\\) by reducing the demand for investment.\n\n\\(u^*\\): The Natural Rate of Unemployment\nKnown as the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU), \\(u^*\\) is the lowest unemployment an economy can sustain without triggering inflation.\nFactors influencing \\(u^*\\):\n\nLabor market flexibility: Countries with more flexible labor markets, like the U.S., tend to have lower \\(u^*\\).\nDemographics and skills: Changes in workforce structure or the ability of the economy to absorb new workers can push up or lower \\(u^*\\).\nTechnological disruption can raise \\(u^*\\) temporarily as industries transition, displacing workers.\n\n\\(\\pi^*\\): The Inflation Target\nThis is the central bank’s target inflation rate, typically around 2%.\nFactors affecting \\(\\pi^*\\):\n\nInflation expectations: Well-anchored expectations tend to keep inflation close to the target.\nSupply shocks, such as oil price spikes, can temporarily push inflation above its target.\n\n\\(g^*\\): The Potential Growth Rate\nThe economy’s ideal growth rate, or the speed at which it can expand without causing inflation.\nFactors impacting \\(g^*\\):\n\nTechnological innovation boosts productivity, raising \\(g^*\\).\nLabor force growth: An expanding labor force can drive \\(g^*\\) higher if job creation keeps pace.\nCapital accumulation through investments in infrastructure and technology also influences \\(g^*\\).\n\n\n\n\nInterconnections Between the Stars\nThe macroeconomic stars are not isolated; they interact in ways that are crucial for shaping economic policy. Here are some important interrelationships:\n\nThe Growth-Interest Nexus: \\(r^*\\) and \\(g^*\\)\nAs the economy’s growth potential (\\(g^*\\)) rises, the natural interest rate (\\(r^*\\)) often follows.\n\nExample: During the 1990s tech boom, the U.S. experienced both strong growth and higher interest rates as the Federal Reserve raised rates to prevent overheating.\n\nThe Labor-Interest Link: \\(u^*\\) and \\(r^*\\)\nLower interest rates can reduce unemployment by encouraging investment, but if unemployment falls too far below \\(u^*\\), inflation can rise, forcing central banks to raise \\(r^*\\).\n\nExample: Germany’s labor market reforms in the early 2000s reduced unemployment and allowed the European Central Bank to keep interest rates low.\n\nThe Phillips Curve: \\(\\pi^*\\) and \\(u^*\\)\nThe Phillips Curve reflects the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. If unemployment drops too low, inflation tends to rise.\n\nExample: In the U.S. post-COVID recovery, rapid wage increases drove inflation above target, leading the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.\n\n\n\n\nThe \\(r^*\\)-\\(g^*\\) Gap: A Key Indicator for Policy\nThe gap between \\(r^*\\) (natural interest rate) and \\(g^*\\) (growth potential) is a useful indicator of the economy’s condition.\n\nPositive Gap: \\(r^*\\) is Greater than \\(g^*\\)\nA positive \\(r^*\\)-\\(g^*\\) gap often signals tight monetary policy or constrained growth potential.\n\nExample: Following the oil shocks of the 1970s, high inflation led central banks to sharply raise interest rates, creating a positive gap.\n\nNegative Gap: \\(g^*\\) is Greater than \\(r^*\\)\nA negative \\(r^*\\)-\\(g^*\\) gap is usually seen during economic recoveries, where low interest rates stimulate growth.\n\nExample: After the 2008 financial crisis, central banks kept interest rates near zero to support recovery, creating a negative gap.\n\n\n\n\nAligning the Stars for Sustainable Growth\nPolicymakers can influence these stars to promote long-term economic stability and growth. Key strategies include:\n\nBoosting Productivity Growth: Investing in innovation, education, and infrastructure can raise \\(g^*\\), allowing for faster growth without causing inflation.\nEnsuring Labor Market Flexibility: Reforms that make it easier for workers to switch jobs or acquire new skills can help lower \\(u^*\\) without overheating the economy.\nAnchoring Inflation Expectations: Central banks should focus on keeping inflation expectations stable, especially during crises or supply shocks.\nMonitoring Global Trends: External factors like global capital flows, demographic changes, and supply shocks must be accounted for when setting monetary policy.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nMacroeconomic stars like \\(r^*\\), \\(u^*\\), \\(\\pi^*\\), and \\(g^*\\) guide policymakers in navigating the complex global economy. By understanding the interactions between these stars, governments and central banks can better align them for sustainable growth, stable inflation, and low unemployment. As we face future challenges and opportunities, keeping these stars in balance will be crucial for maintaining economic prosperity."

    "title": "The Capital Conundrum: Why More Isn’t Always Better in Economics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the pursuit of economic growth, the intuitive strategy might seem straightforward: invest more capital to produce more output. After all, if one machine can produce 100 widgets a day, shouldn’t ten machines produce 1,000? While this linear expectation is tempting, the reality of economics tells a different story—one where adding more capital leads to smaller and smaller gains in output. This phenomenon is known as diminishing marginal returns, and it plays a pivotal role in shaping investment strategies, business decisions, and economic policies worldwide.\n\n\n\nImagine you have a small garden plot where you’re growing tomatoes. You start by planting one seedling, which yields a decent harvest. Enthusiastic about your success, you decide to plant more seedlings in the same space. Initially, as you add more plants, your total harvest increases. However, as the garden becomes overcrowded, each additional plant has less soil, water, and sunlight available. Eventually, adding more plants doesn’t just yield a smaller increase in tomatoes—it might even reduce your total harvest due to competition for resources.\nThis garden scenario mirrors how diminishing marginal returns operate in economics. Just as plants compete for finite resources, capital investments (like machinery or equipment) rely on other fixed inputs—such as labor, technology, or raw materials—to be effective. Without proportional increases in these complementary factors, the benefits of additional capital begin to wane.\n\n\n\nAt its core, the law of diminishing marginal returns states that if we keep adding more of one input (capital, in this case) while holding others constant, the extra output generated from each additional unit of input will eventually decline.\n\n\n\nFixed Complementary Resources:\nLabor Limitations: If the number of workers remains the same, there are only so many hands to operate new machines. Adding more equipment doesn’t help if there’s no one to use it.\nPhysical Space Constraints: Just like our overcrowded garden, factories and facilities have limited space. Cramming in more machines can lead to inefficiencies and safety hazards.\nOperational Inefficiencies:\n\nMaintenance Overhead: More machinery requires more upkeep. The time and cost spent on maintenance can offset the benefits of increased production capacity.\nComplex Coordination: Managing a larger pool of assets can complicate logistics, leading to bottlenecks and delays.\n\n\n-Technological Stagnation: - Diminished Innovation Impact: The first investments often bring significant technological improvements. Subsequent investments might not offer the same leap in efficiency. - Obsolescence Risks: Investing heavily in capital without technological upgrades can tie up resources in equipment that may soon become outdated.\n\nHuman Capital and Skills Gap:\n\nTraining Requirements: New equipment might require specialized skills. Without adequate training, workers can’t utilize the capital effectively.\nProductivity Plateau: There’s a limit to how much one worker can produce, even with the best tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA factory producing smartphones decides to double its number of assembly machines to meet anticipated demand. However, the number of trained technicians remains the same. Initially, production increases, but soon, machines sit idle due to a lack of operators. The crowded workspace leads to slower movement and increased errors, negating the benefits of the new machines.\n\n\n\nA customer service company invests in more phone lines and computers to improve service capacity. Yet, without hiring additional customer service representatives, the extra equipment remains unused. The existing staff can’t handle more calls simultaneously, so the investment doesn’t translate into better service or higher output.\n\n\n\n\nEconomists often use the Cobb-Douglas production function to model the relationship between inputs (capital and labor) and output:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nY = AK^{\\alpha} L^{1-\\alpha}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\\(Y\\): Total Output\n\\(A\\): Total Factor Productivity (technology level)\n\\(K\\): Capital Input\n\\(L\\): Labor Input\n\\(\\alpha\\): income share of capital (output elasticity of capital) (a value between 0 and 1)\n\nWhen labor \\(L\\) and technology \\(A\\) are held constant, increasing capital \\(𝐾\\) leads to smaller increments in output \\(𝑌\\) because \\(α\\) is less than 1. The exponent 𝛼α signifies diminishing returns—each additional unit of capital contributes less to output than the previous one.\n\n\n\nWhile diminishing marginal returns present a challenge, they aren’t an insurmountable barrier to growth. Here are ways businesses and economies can address the issue:\n\nInvesting in Human Capital:\nTraining and Education: Equipping the workforce with new skills ensures they can effectively utilize additional capital.\nHiring More Staff: Balancing capital investment with an increase in labor prevents the underutilization of resources.\nTechnological Innovation:\nUpgrading Technology: Advances can shift the production function upward, meaning the same amount of capital and labor produces more output.\nAutomation and AI: Smart technologies can optimize the use of capital, reducing inefficiencies.\nImproving Resource Allocation:\n\nProcess Optimization: Streamlining operations can help maximize the productivity of existing capital.\nFlexible Production Systems: Implementing adaptable systems allows for better scaling of inputs based on demand.\n\nExpanding Complementary Inputs:\nSupply Chain Enhancement: Ensuring a steady supply of raw materials prevents bottlenecks that can stifle production.\nInfrastructure Development: Improving transportation and logistics can enhance the effectiveness of capital investments.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding diminishing marginal returns is crucial for policymakers:\n\nBalanced Growth Strategies: Emphasizing not just capital accumulation but also education, healthcare, and technology development leads to sustainable economic growth.\nIncentivizing Innovation: Policies that promote research and development can help economies overcome the limitations imposed by diminishing returns.\nInfrastructure Investment: Developing infrastructure supports the efficient use of capital across various sectors.\n\n\n\n\nThe allure of simply adding more capital to boost output is a mirage that fades under the scrutiny of diminishing marginal returns. Recognizing that “more isn’t always better” is essential for businesses aiming for sustainable growth and for economies striving for long-term prosperity. By balancing capital investments with improvements in labor, technology, and other resources, we can cultivate a fertile ground where every additional seed of investment has the space and nutrients to grow to its full potential."

    "text": "The war in Ukraine has raised significantly the odds of a recession in the near term, but also the likelihood to move into a new inflation regime as in the 70s. How real this risk is, depends on the key differentiating factors between now and then.\nIn a nutshell, textbooks would tell that a sequence of oil crises (rooted, like now, in geopolitical factors) permanently increased the cost of production for firms and, by extension, the cost of goods and services. This subsequently triggered a wage-price spiral (as households were trying to catch up with rising prices) which led to ever-increasing inflation. Such past experience places a material probability that a similar mechanism triggered by the same factors (oil shock and high inflation) might re-emerge with the Fed or all other major central banks unable to control inflation.\nA closer look, however, at the underlying factors that underpinned the mechanism behind this wage-price spiral would suggest that this time is different. In short, the structurally weaker bargaining power of workers and its dependency on the economic cycle is effectively putting an upper limit to any catch-up of wages with extreme inflation. The direct implication of this key differentiating factor alone is that a) any wage-price spiral is likely to be short-lived relative to the 70s, especially when growth would start to slow down and b) the cost-push shocks are unlikely to turn into permanent supply shocks as then.\nIn the rest of this post, I will mostly focus on discussing this argument in more detail, along with a few other, more known, key dissimilarities between then and now. In my mind, I have mostly the US economy, but some of the arguments are relevant to other countries, too.\n\n\nOne obvious difference between now and then, is that this wage-price spiral that unfolded during the 70s was heavily relying on the structurally strong bargaining power of workers that is absent today. Workers at the time were unionised and their bargaining power did not necessarily depend on the tightness of the labour market or the state of the economy as now. Currently, a recession or a slowdown in economic activity (either due to monetary policy tightening or a negative shock such as now with oil prices) is almost automatically reducing the bargaining power of most workers, and this in a fashion that nominal wages might not necessarily catch-up with inflation without legislation.\nAn exception here might be the high-income high-skilled households who nevertheless tend to consume less energy-intensive products (with declining overtime cost of production due to technological advancements) while their high marginal propensity to save diminishes the strength of aggregate demand on prices (formally flattening of the Philips Curve). This also highlights that in the absence of trade unions the degree of (wage or income) inequalities is another confounding factor that stops wages from catching up with inflation and implies that, on the aggregate, real wages most likely would fall. This effect in turn can help offset the (often reversible) production costs due to higher energy prices and help prevent the cost-push shocks to turn permanent.\nPut more simply, the structurally weaker bargaining position of workers in effect implies that any temporary cost-push shocks are less likely to manifest themselves into the permanent supply shock of the 70s, especially since oil is now a less important input to production compared to the past.\nNew modes of work arrangements and the ability of multinationals to either outsource or reallocate abroad (expensive) labour-intensive functions are two other factors that can reduce the persistence of cost-push shocks. For example, competition might force firms to contain their labour costs and among the available options they have is to offer indefinite work-from-home arrangements. This new mode of working could lift some of the pressure for workers to catch up with inflation when they are given the option to indefinitely move to less expensive regions. On the other hand, multinationals might choose to react more aggressively if they think their profitability is severely distressed. For example, they could choose to outsource some of their labour-intensive high-skill functions or reallocate their workers abroad. Given their size in the economy and the limited availability of quality jobs for high-skilled workers in advanced economies, this might further reduce the bargaining power of workers when economic growth slows down.\n\n\n\nSecondly, the world now is structurally very different from the 70s. We live in a world where the global economy (perhaps for the first time in its history) is producing an excess amount of savings with record-low real investments. With governments around the world not really solving this problem, it is extremely unlikely to see any change in this structural issue in the foreseeable future. This dearth of investments contains, therefore, a very strong deflationary process that was totally absent during the 70s.\nThe forced coordination across countries to transition to net-zero, or the accidental coordination to increase defence spending (which has little to no influence on \\(r^{*}\\), the natural interest rate), is unlikely to outweigh the strong incentives to save that come from demographics, higher inequalities, structural weaknesses in labour markets combined with a weaker welfare state, and government or private market schemes, such as private pension schemes or other unfunded social security programs. These schemes typically raise the incentives to save, but at the cost of depressed returns on capital and higher financial risk. This further reinforces the incentive to save to reach target wealth levels by retirement, which in turn further depresses returns, and so on (a “savings trap”). We now know from experience that in this world, financial markets have a stronger incentive to keep most of the liquidity in the financial system (in search of yield) rather than finance real investments that depend on a very weak long-term growth outlook.\n\n\n\nThere are a few other more nuanced differentiating factors that are worth highlighting here. First, the degree of financialization together with the prevalence of idiosyncratic financial risks to households unveils other strong deflationary forces.\nFor households, is safe to assume that it is more challenging now to insure against the risk of employment, career and job displacement risks, health shocks etc. So, the most important insurance mechanism against bad outcomes is to build up buffers of savings and more wealth. Such a (structural) precautionary savings motive might be stronger today than in the past for a number of reasons:\n\nMuch weaker welfare states and employment protection that increase the severity of possible negative income shocks (which academic economists showed also explain the skewness of, much more uneven today, wealth distribution )\nMore leveraged households are extremely susceptible to negative wealth shocks mainly due to the housing market\nMore individualistic societies that make people rely more on their own feet than expect the help of others. Having money and building up wealth becomes then a high-order priority for most households to survive any adverse outcome or to increase their quality of life.\n\nSecond, the degree of financialization, as is captured by what economists might call market incompleteness, has increased since the 70s due to the liberalisation of capital flows and the availability of more hedging instruments. Now, the degree by which investors can hedge against risks is substantially greater today than before. In a world in which liquidity is abundant, this reinforces the incentives of the financial system to allocate more money into (risky) financial assets rather finance real investments (which as said before rely on a weak long-term growth outlook).\n\n\n\nAlthough this analysis is anything but comprehensive and the future is always uncertain, I highlighted here a few crucial differentiating factors that play a dominant role in most economies today and are important for the inflation regime. The deflationary forces from the structurally weaker labour force not only put an upper limit to the wage-price spiral (that is central to many peoples’ arguments for inflation to go out of hand) but also limit the extent by which a cost-push shock can turn into a permanent supply shock. This, together with the legacies from the “excess savings world”, unleashes a strong deflationary process that can only be reversed by either a serious escalation in the war in Ukraine (a largely unpredictable factor) or by some serious policy mistake from now on.\nAll these suggest that the Fed can still control inflation, albeit at the cost of a recession or slow economic growth in the near term. In addition, the structural characteristics in the labour markets also imply that the deflationary process might be asymmetric and less synchronised across countries (i.e. the opposite case with the existing inflation dynamics).\nFor Eurozone countries, which also inherit other critical similarities with the 70s such as the “fixed exchange rate” regime, rising public debt, and current account imbalances, as well as, feature higher sensitivity to oil prices, inflation might become a source of a new political conflict due to ECB’s hawkish turn. This adds a greater uncertainty in Eurozone countries around the long-term inflation outlook and does not rule out the possibility that some countries might indeed experience relatively long stagflation given the ECB’s asymmetric (recessionary) implications and their different structural characteristics, and the imperfect political and fiscal union."

    "title": "Fed’s Forward Guidance",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Over the past two years, the Federal Reserve has been criticized by a wide range of actors, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), financial markets, top academic economists, and even its own top officials, for being too slow to act on inflation and maintaining a monetary policy stance that is too loose given record high inflation. However, many of these arguments still rely on backward-looking measures, such as the distance of the policy rate from neutral, as well as on “old-school” thinking that implicitly ignores how much of an impact forward guidance can have.\n\n\n\n\nIn this post, I present a few key facts about how the Federal Reserve has used forward guidance in recent decades. I also discuss how the Fed’s credibility has added a record-high degree of extra tightening, which began much sooner than is publicly discussed or acknowledged.\n\n\n\n\nIn the world of central banking, there are few policies that have been as widely discussed in recent years as forward guidance and balance sheet changes. These policy tools, known as non-conventional policies, define the broader monetary policy stance that goes beyond just setting the policy rate. For example, forward guidance is a method used by central banks to directly communicate or signal their intentions in order to shape expectations and influence interest rates in the desired direction. During the 2008 financial crisis, forward guidance and Quantitative Easing (QE) became especially critical tools, as the policy rate hit zero. In order to continue stimulating the economy, the Federal Reserve (Fed) needed to find new ways to do so. As Ben Bernanke put it, “we had to be creative.” Forward guidance allowed the Fed to do just that. More recently, forward guidance has played an important role in the ongoing debate over inflation. In this post, I will be looking at a few stylized facts about how the Fed uses this tool.\n\n\n\nOne way to measure the Fed’s unconventional policies is to look at the “proxy rate”, which is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (See here and here). The proxy rate combines the Fed’s policy rate with the level of interest rate implied by the balance sheet changes and direct communication. Hence it incorporates the hypothetical interest rate that associates with the unconventional components of monetary policy.\nI have plotted the proxy and policy rate in Figure 1 below. The proxy rate leads the actual policy rate because of the way monetary policy is implemented. Typically, the markets are set up in anticipation of a change in the policy rate before the change actually takes place. This pattern is (unsurprisingly) pronounced after 2007.\nBefore the global financial crisis, the proxy rate and the fund rate were closely correlated. However, they started to diverge after 2007, when quantitative easing (QE) and forward guidance became integral components of the monetary policy framework. During this period, the use of forward guidance amounted to a monetary policy stance of negative interest rates (validating the purpose that it was designed). These ultra-low interest rates persisted until 2014 according to the proxy rate. At that point the Fed started tightening its policy until the pandemic hit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Proxy and Policy Rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fed has been criticized (including by respected academics) for acting too slowly to address inflation, but the truth is that they began to tighten financial conditions well before the interest rate hikes. In fact, they started eight months before the first hike in March 2022, and almost a year and a half after the pandemic shock (Figure 1). This is important to note, because when the Fed changed course, inflation was mostly driven by supply-side factors, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. This left less room for monetary policy to do much. However, the Fed clearly began to change course before the pressure from the demand side on inflation started to substantially pick up.\nIt’s worth emphasizing that even prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the proxy rate and the fund rate were not identical. Part of this discrepancy can be attributed to the inevitable measurement errors involved in calculating a statistical measure such as the proxy rate. Of course, it’s impossible to completely eliminate statistical errors, but we can reasonably assume that most of the difference between the proxy rate and the fund rate can be attributed to communication-related factors.\nThis evidence makes it clear that the inclusion of forward guidance and other unconventional tools has expanded the criteria by which the monetary policy stance should be evaluated. It is now clear that the Fed has become looser than it appears when stimulating the economy, and tighter than the policy rate indicates when tightening. As a result, it is becoming more important to get a better sense of the magnitude of the non-conventional aspects of monetary policy. The following paragraphs will examine this issue more closely.\n\n\n\nThe difference between the proxy and policy rate shows the level of interest rate implied by the Fed’s forward guidance. Figure 2 shows exactly this. For example, at the peak of the proxy rate during this monetary policy tightening cycle, the Fed added an extra 3% to the policy rate by just pointing what will be doing. This means that until October 2022, the economy was effectively operating at an interest rate level closer to 6% than the official policy rate of 3%1. It was only after October 2022 that the proxy rate start coming off, signaling a less hawkish stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Interest Rates equivalent of Direct Communication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFed’s tone shift was mostly evident in Jay Powell’s Jackson Hole speech last August who declared “the Federal Reserve must keep at it until the job is done”. The US stock market slid sharply after Powell spoke, with the benchmark S&P 500 index falling 3.4 per cent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3.9 per cent, recording the one biggest one-day decline for both indices (outside sudden crashes).\nTo put things in perspective, in Figure 3 I show the magnitude of this and other messages since 2020 and compare the unconventional part of the monetary policy to historical standards. The calculations are still based on the distance between the proxy rate and the policy rate. The left panel shows the average impact of communication-related factors across all tightening episodes since mid-70s as identified by the proxy rate. For the relevant periods, I have also filtered out the direct impact of balance sheet changes2. The right panel shows the distribution of the interest rates implied by forward guidance across each decades3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Monetary Policy Tightening Cycles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Bernanke once said that “monetary policy is 99% words and 1% action.” This was certainly true in the current tightening cycle, where the Fed’s words had an unprecedented impact. The Fed’s communication and signaling factors added (on average) an additional 1.5 percent of interest rates hikes, which is three times more than the most aggressive Fed of the past.\nThe credibility factor also played a role here. Before gaining the “credibility medal” the Fed struggled to convince the markets in the first two tightening cycles in Figure 3, even though it raised rates significantly. Things changed with Paul Volcker, but it wasn’t until forward guidance became part of the monetary policy transmission mechanism that markets started taking the Fed seriously.\nAnother way to look at the impact of the Fed’s messaging in recent years is to look at the right panel of Figure 3, where I have plotted the distribution of the impact of forward guidance (in terms of interest rates). The Fed is now more likely to be seen as hawkish than dovish, given its seriousness in fighting inflation and the fact that markets still have faith in its words. This was not the case in the 1970s and 1980s. It is also worth noting that the formal incorporation of forward guidance has managed to have a relatively even impact across different economic conditions, indicating some ability to weigh the balance of risks and fine-tune its words to the situation.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, the Fed has carried out the swiftest policy rate increase in the history of the United States. As I have briefly discussed in a previous post, the present interest rate level suggests that the impact on output is likely to be just as significant. This implies that the response from the Fed’s end has been sufficiently forceful in all areas under its direct control. It’s hard not to draw the conclusion that we are presently experiencing the most hawkish monetary policy position in recent US history, and its repercussions are just beginning to materialize4.\nDoes this mean that a soft landing is off the table? That’s a whole other discussion. But the short answer is “No”. In fact, the opposite is true. According to this evidence, the Fed’s actions are what kept a soft landing on the cards. And, this shouldn’t be surprising. Technically, only the Fed needs to comply to a soft landing because of its mandate to balance maximum employment and price stability. Other central banks don’t have this restriction5.\nNevertheless, soft landing is still the holy grail of central banking. R. Dornbusch famously said, “No postwar recovery has died in bed of old age—the Federal Reserve has murdered every one of them”. The most notable (and technically the only) soft landing in the most recent 16 business cycles occurred in 1994 under Alan Greenspan. Inflation was rising rapidly in 1994, and Greenspan raised interest rates seven times in the space of a year, bringing them up to 6%. This was a significant increase, but it did not cause a recession. In fact, the economy continued to grow throughout 1994 and 1995. Why was it successful? Economists will pick three main reasons:\n\nFirst, the economy was strong at the time, which helped to cushion the impact of the higher interest rates.\nSecond, Greenspan was able to communicate his intentions clearly to the public, which helped to reduce uncertainty.\nThird, Greenspan was able to raise interest rates gradually, giving businesses and consumers time to adjust.\n\nIn Figure 4, I plotted this episode and compared it to the current tightening cycle. I also added the “Hard landing” of Volcker (which was essentially started by Burns and Miller) and the in-between tightening cycle of 1999 to make the case clearer. Before the 1980s, any comparisons are meaningless, as the Gold Standard was in place, there was a substantially different monetary policy framework, and fiscal dominance was the norm. I also ignored the tightening cycle that preceded the Global Financial Crisis (for obvious reasons) and the tightening cycle of 2018, as it was disrupted by the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Monetary Policy Tightening Cycles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fed’s reaction function under Greenspan and now is quite similar, including making up for Friedman’s “long and variable lags.” However, unlike in the past, the use of unconventional tools allows the Fed to adjust its policy more smoothly and early on, without raising the policy rate. The three conditions that made Greenspan a legend continue to hold in some reasonable sense. The dynamics are also similar to the tightening cycle of 1999, which ended with the dot-com crash. However, as the “mini” banking crisis clearly demonstrated, the financial system is much more resilient today. Of course, there are some factors that are different between now and then, such as the starting level of inflation.\nTo conclude, a soft landing is primarily a fine-tuning exercise that is difficult to achieve, almost identical if not as elusive as timing the market. Based on the evidence here, the Fed has taken all necessary steps to achieve this goal and some of the necessary conditions for a soft landing are clearly met. But I do think that, overall, luck factors are more important than they were in the past6."

    "text": "In the world of central banking, there are few policies that have been as widely discussed in recent years as forward guidance and balance sheet changes. These policy tools, known as non-conventional policies, define the broader monetary policy stance that goes beyond just setting the policy rate. For example, forward guidance is a method used by central banks to directly communicate or signal their intentions in order to shape expectations and influence interest rates in the desired direction. During the 2008 financial crisis, forward guidance and Quantitative Easing (QE) became especially critical tools, as the policy rate hit zero. In order to continue stimulating the economy, the Federal Reserve (Fed) needed to find new ways to do so. As Ben Bernanke put it, “we had to be creative.” Forward guidance allowed the Fed to do just that. More recently, forward guidance has played an important role in the ongoing debate over inflation. In this post, I will be looking at a few stylized facts about how the Fed uses this tool."

    "title": "Fed’s Forward Guidance",
    "section": "",
    "text": "One way to measure the Fed’s unconventional policies is to look at the “proxy rate”, which is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (See here and here). The proxy rate combines the Fed’s policy rate with the level of interest rate implied by the balance sheet changes and direct communication. Hence it incorporates the hypothetical interest rate that associates with the unconventional components of monetary policy.\nI have plotted the proxy and policy rate in Figure 1 below. The proxy rate leads the actual policy rate because of the way monetary policy is implemented. Typically, the markets are set up in anticipation of a change in the policy rate before the change actually takes place. This pattern is (unsurprisingly) pronounced after 2007.\nBefore the global financial crisis, the proxy rate and the fund rate were closely correlated. However, they started to diverge after 2007, when quantitative easing (QE) and forward guidance became integral components of the monetary policy framework. During this period, the use of forward guidance amounted to a monetary policy stance of negative interest rates (validating the purpose that it was designed). These ultra-low interest rates persisted until 2014 according to the proxy rate. At that point the Fed started tightening its policy until the pandemic hit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Proxy and Policy Rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fed has been criticized (including by respected academics) for acting too slowly to address inflation, but the truth is that they began to tighten financial conditions well before the interest rate hikes. In fact, they started eight months before the first hike in March 2022, and almost a year and a half after the pandemic shock (Figure 1). This is important to note, because when the Fed changed course, inflation was mostly driven by supply-side factors, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. This left less room for monetary policy to do much. However, the Fed clearly began to change course before the pressure from the demand side on inflation started to substantially pick up.\nIt’s worth emphasizing that even prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the proxy rate and the fund rate were not identical. Part of this discrepancy can be attributed to the inevitable measurement errors involved in calculating a statistical measure such as the proxy rate. Of course, it’s impossible to completely eliminate statistical errors, but we can reasonably assume that most of the difference between the proxy rate and the fund rate can be attributed to communication-related factors.\nThis evidence makes it clear that the inclusion of forward guidance and other unconventional tools has expanded the criteria by which the monetary policy stance should be evaluated. It is now clear that the Fed has become looser than it appears when stimulating the economy, and tighter than the policy rate indicates when tightening. As a result, it is becoming more important to get a better sense of the magnitude of the non-conventional aspects of monetary policy. The following paragraphs will examine this issue more closely."

    "text": "The difference between the proxy and policy rate shows the level of interest rate implied by the Fed’s forward guidance. Figure 2 shows exactly this. For example, at the peak of the proxy rate during this monetary policy tightening cycle, the Fed added an extra 3% to the policy rate by just pointing what will be doing. This means that until October 2022, the economy was effectively operating at an interest rate level closer to 6% than the official policy rate of 3%1. It was only after October 2022 that the proxy rate start coming off, signaling a less hawkish stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Interest Rates equivalent of Direct Communication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFed’s tone shift was mostly evident in Jay Powell’s Jackson Hole speech last August who declared “the Federal Reserve must keep at it until the job is done”. The US stock market slid sharply after Powell spoke, with the benchmark S&P 500 index falling 3.4 per cent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3.9 per cent, recording the one biggest one-day decline for both indices (outside sudden crashes).\nTo put things in perspective, in Figure 3 I show the magnitude of this and other messages since 2020 and compare the unconventional part of the monetary policy to historical standards. The calculations are still based on the distance between the proxy rate and the policy rate. The left panel shows the average impact of communication-related factors across all tightening episodes since mid-70s as identified by the proxy rate.

This may not completely capture the full impact, but it should be close. Only the first round of QE was strong enough. Subsequent rounds were less effective as markets anticipated the Fed’s actions.

These behaviors are generally stable and predictable have more uncertain indirect effects, hence making the “long and variable lags” of monetary policy hard to assess in real-time. Supply shocks are also “luck factors” from the policy-making point of view as central banks have no control on how to tackle them. The can of course try to respond by offsetting their impact, but this is not a good policy. It is far better to have governments address the source of the problem. In addition, a soft landing substantially depends on the pace at which central banks want to bring inflation down. A fast pace implies less chance of a soft landing, as it would require the real economy to be crashed. Too slow also reduces the chance of a soft landing, as there is a high chance that inflation expectations will become de-anchored or new unfavorable shocks might hit the system.↩︎"

    "title": "Is the US Fiscal Policy Reckless?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "For some time, the United States’ fiscal policy has been expansionary, resulting in an increase in public debt. The recent pandemic shock added another record amount of public debt, raising concerns about whether the US public debt is too high and thus unsustainable. However, when some key fundamentals are considered, there is no compelling case to be made that US fiscal policy is reckless. On the contrary, the fact that the US public debt has been rising for some time is actually a good thing considering the prevailing fundamentals of secular trends.\n\n\n\nThe US public debt has reached about 100% of GDP, and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that it will continue to rise if the US government continues to accumulate deficits (Figure 1). This raises concerns about the sustainability of public debt and the US fiscal policy more generally. Unsustainable US public debt could crack the entire financial system, with devastating consequences for the global economy. All of this has led to the (false) perception that US fiscal policy is “reckless” and government debt is out of control. In this post, I will give a quick overview of US fiscal policy and explain why I believe that this is not the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Evolution of Public Debt and Budget Deficits in the US. The debit limit is taken from Mehrotra and Sergeyev\n\n\n\nIn the following sections, I will first provide an overview of the US fiscal situation and what primarily drives budget deficits. Then I’ll quickly discuss whether public debt is sustainable, and then I’ll conclude with a normative discussion of whether US fiscal policy is truly “reckless”. To be clear, the discussion here is about the trajectory of public debt, that is, its historical and expected trend.\n\n\n\nFiscal stance is a measure of whether government policy is stimulating the economy (expansionary), having no impact (neutral), or slowing the economy (contractionary). One common way to measure fiscal stance is the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CAPB) as a fraction of potential output. Primary balance is the government’s budget balance adjusted for the business cycle. This removes the effects of the economic cycle on government budgets, so it is a better measure of policy decisions1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Fiscal Stance is calculated as the negative of CAPB. A positive fiscal stance indicates expansionary fiscal policy, while a negative fiscal stance indicates contractionary fiscal policy. Fiscal impulse is the year-over-year change in fiscal stance. A positive fiscal impulse indicates that the government is becoming more expansionary, while a negative fiscal impulse indicates that the government is becoming in this case less expansionary.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows that fiscal policy in the United States has been particularly expansionary at least since 2002 and according to IMF’s recent projections it is expected to remain so in the coming years, albeit at a slower pace. That means the US fiscal policy has been running deficits (unrelated to the cycle of the economy) for at least the last 20 years, and there is a good chance that this will continue.\n\n\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in the US groups spending into three broad categories: mandatory, discretionary, and interest spending. Mandatory outlays is seen as necessary for the economy to function, making it more difficult to change the law. In contrast, discretionary spending, such as defense spending, is more up to the government to decide what to do and hence is easier to change. The third category is self-explanatory: it is the interest paid by the government on its public debt.\nSo, what drives the US’s expansionary fiscal policy? According to the CBO data (Figure 3), the majority of the US government’s spending is on mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare. As we can see, mandatory spending as a percentage of total outlays has been rising, particularly since the 1990s, and will most likely continue to consume the most of budgetary resources in the future. What we’re seeing here is the growing fiscal cost of population ageing as more people become eligible for mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare. This is a problem that most of the advanced world is dealing with, not just the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: US Government Spending (% Total)\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, as the US began to invest less in national defense after the end of Cold War, the share of discretionary spending in the budget has been declining over time and this trajectory is expected to continue. Finally, the share of interest payments has been hovering around 10% of the budget for all of these years, though it is expected to reach record levels as public indebtedness rises under unchanged policies. Overall, however, the cost of social programs would continue to dominate the budget.\nSpending is only one factor contributing to the budget deficits. Obviously, the other factor that determines deficits is revenues. I will skip a detailed analysis here. Clearly, revenues were insufficient in comparison to total expenditures. What is worth commenting, however, is that tax revenues as a percentage of GDP were only 25% in 2019, much lower than the OECD average. Now, according to the CBO, revenues account for approximately 20% of GDP. This also implies a reluctance to raise taxes to finance the fiscal impact of an ageing population or to support the delivery of essential public services. In terms of the United States’ overall budgetary policy, I would say that deficits are more of a tax issue than a spending issue.\n\n\n\nThe growing US debt deficit raises concerns about the sustainability of public finances. To assess the situation, I will examine some key fundamentals.\n\nLow overall Borrowing costs:\n\nMarkets place a lot of emphasis on borrowing costs. Not unjustifiably considering that politicians cannot directly control interest payments. However, if you start reading the news, you will think that US start being charged loan-sharking interest rates. Let’s see what the reality looks like. Below I show the effective interest rate against the 10-year U.S. Treasury (UST) bond. The effective interest rate is the overall cost of borrowing that takes into account all interest rates that the US government is charged for issuing different debt products. For convenience, I also have the monetary policy cycles since 1960s. Here what is worth commenting is that monetary policy play does not seem to play a particular role for the sustainability of debt. Other fundamentals, like level of debt, population and technological growth, productivity, and so on, are the factors mostly influencing trends in borrowing costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: US Borrowing costs\n\n\n\nIn the current situation, do you see anything to worry about here? I don’t. Overall borrowing costs are at the same levels as before the pandemic (Figure 4). Debt service costs are still low, which is understandable given that long-term interest rates were structurally low before COVID-19. The monetary shock of the last 18 months is starting to have an impact on borrowing costs, but it is highly questionable whether this situation will last for too long as the diagram above also shows. It is also important to note that these are nominal borrowing costs. Subtracting inflation (which helps to deflate debt), the cost of borrowing is even lower .\nSecondly, consider the years preceding the 1980s. The era of rising borrowing costs. We can see that the effective interest rate was constantly below the 10y UST. This reflects the ability of governments to partially hedge its borrowing costs against rising interest rates by rolling-over debt and exploiting different maturity structures. After the long-standing structural problems of the last few decades, the maturity structure played less of a role because interest rates across different maturities start converging to the same levels, and thus the effective interest rate and the 10y UST were quite similar2.\n\nFavorable r-g fundamentals:\n\nBorrowing costs on their own do not necessarily matter. Measuring public indebtedness as a fraction of GDP, what effectively matters is the effective interest rate in relation to economic growth. In public finance literature, this is usually written as \\(r-g\\), where \\(r\\) is the previously mentioned effective interest rate and \\(g\\) is the nominal growth rate of the economy. This \\(r-g\\) gap has a simple explanation. When the economy grows faster than debt, the debt-to-GDP ratio falls (and vice versa). In practice, and from purely a public finance perspective, extra debt may be added when the government is dis-saving (accumulates primary deficits) or removed when the government saves money (accumulates primary surpluses). Then, the debt creating flows (i.e. how public debt changes period-by-period) can be decomposed in two main parts: the contribution of the \\(r-g\\) dynamics and b) the behavior of primary balances. Anything else we can assume for simplicity are residual factors (such the so called stock-flow adjustments). This decomposition is also appealing because it provides a high-level overview of the part of public debt over which politicians have direct control, namely primary balances, and the part over which they do not, namely \\(r-g\\) dynamics. So, how does the picture come together when we put all of these pieces together? This is how this decomposition looks when using CBO data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Debt Creating Flows\n\n\n\nFigure 5 which deconstructs the year-over-year change in public debt into \\(r-g\\), primary balances, and residual factors, reveals that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) anticipates that \\(r-g\\) dynamics will remain favorable at levels comparable to the previous decade. This suggests there is no compelling reason to believe that the national debt has gotten out of hand. Just balancing out the books the debt-to-GDP would be facing a falling trajectory. But even if we assume that public debt can reach quite high levels, such as 150%-180% of GDP, the baseline projections imply that the US government would need a small primary surplus, close to 1%-1.5% of GDP, to stabilize debt at that levels. Not trivial, but not difficult either, given how feasible such an adjustment is for such an extremely high public debt level3.\n\nBalance of Risks\n\nHowever, debt sustainability is more than just a baseline. From the perspective of risk management, the distribution of r-g shocks, which encompass virtually every type of shock that could occur in the United States as well as internationally, is also crucial. How does this appear when examining the history of these shocks?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Distribution of r-g shocks\n\n\n\nFigure 6 shows the historical distribution of the r−g gap since the 1960s, as well as after the mid-1990s and what the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects. This analysis leads to two conclusions:\n\nA negative r−g gap is usually the norm than the exception across all cases.\nThe balance of risks is asymmetric in favor of public finances, with the likelihood of favorable shocks (\\(r&lt;g\\)) exceeding the chance of an unfavorable shock.\n\nSimply put, during periods of economic uncertainty, governments, particularly the US government, can effectively leverage their perceived stability and creditworthiness to secure advantageous financing terms when issuing debt. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as a “flight to safety,” reflects the heightened demand for safe-haven assets during periods of stress. In such instances, investors seeking to preserve capital gravitate towards the perceived security of government bonds, driving down yields and facilitating debt issuance at attractive rates.\nThe US government, in particular, enjoys a unique position as a global financial anchor, benefiting from its deep and liquid bond market, strong fiscal institutions, and perceived resilience to economic shocks. This privileged status often translates into lower borrowing costs compared to other sovereigns, even during periods of heightened uncertainty.\nWhile specific shocks, such as a US-induced financial crisis, could temporarily disrupt this dynamic, the overall trend suggests that governments, particularly the US government, can effectively utilize debt issuance as a counter-cyclical tool to manage their fiscal needs during periods of stress. In other words, the larger the negative risk event, the higher the bid for US bonds.\n\n\n\nThe previous analysis implies it only implies that the United States has in principle an ability to sustain high debt. But the real question here is whether the US should actually do it. In public debates such strategy is frequently ruled out as reckless. However, in more general terms public debt is a very special instrument, and especially the US debt with the aforementioned properties needs not only balancing the public accounts but also the economy.\nSo, how can we tell if the fiscal situation is reasonable? So far, we have seen that the public debt is still under control. Should we consider where the US spends its money as the primary criterion? Many analysts continue to spread the myth that most US government spending is wasteful, but the vast majority of funds are spent on essential public services. So “reckless” isn’t the right word. Perhaps it’s a better word for the tax policy. The capacity of US deficits to absorb global savings and the (good) potential for crowding out excessive levels of savings and private capital, in my opinion, is the criterion that mostly applies in the current context (and for which where money is spent is less of an issue).\nGenerations of economists have been taught that crowding out private capital is always a bad thing. In the United States, it is definitely an ideologically appealing argument, helped by the fact that saying the opposite is counter-intuitive to the general public. “How can crowding out private investment ever be beneficial to the economy?” someone might ask. Actually, the answer is quite simple:\n\n“…the presumption that increasing investment is always good for the economy relies on the fact that more investment leads to more output in the long run, and that more output helps achieve higher consumption. The first fact is mechanical, but the second is not necessarily true, because more capital also means more investment to maintain the same capital/output ratio. Consequently, there are limits as to how much capital should ideally be accumulated…”4\n\nFor decades, China has focused on export-led growth, but it is now realizing that domestic consumption is a more sustainable driver of economic growth. Japan’s long-term experience with the “savings trap” is another example of the consequences of excess capital.\nBefore proceeding, it is essential to differentiate between crowding out of capital over the business cycle and crowding out of capital over time. According to Keynesian theory, public debt cannot crowd out private investment in the short run, especially during recessions, because private investment is more sensitive to short-term economic growth prospects than to interest rates. However, public debt can crowd out private investment in the long run by increasing interest rates and decreasing the supply of loanable funds. Therefore, when I refer to crowding out of capital, I am referring to this long-term process, not the short-term one. The empirical evidence is crystal clear here and quite robust5.\nTo return to my original point, I believe that until we are really done with the structural problem of excess savings US debt might actually be too low. To clarify, this situation should not be confused with the excess savings from the pandemic or the zero-interest rate policy (ZIRP) era. Even though central bank interest rates are now relatively “high”, the economy may still be accumulating more capital than it needs, as it likely did before the global financial crisis. By excess savings I refer to the structural issue in which the supply of savings permanently exceeds the demand for savings. As we all know by experience, this can lead to a number of economic problems, including slow growth, low interest rates, financial crises, asset bubbles, excessive risk-taking, misallocation of resources. The US public debt is one way to permanently address these problems by creating the extra capacity to absorb more excess savings. The question then is how to assess whether we are still living in this world. The next section takes this issue more closely.\n\n\n\nThe idea that an economy might over-accumulate capital, or save more than it needs to, is a possibility that many people can understand. However, it is more difficult to test this idea empirically and measure it in real time. Before I illustrate this, let us briefly review the concept of capital accumulation. Here I want to clarify that capital, savings, liquidity can be used interchangeably.\nDo you recall Thomas Piketty’s international best-selling book? He referred to the situation in which the long-term interest rate (\\(r^*\\)) exceeds long-term economic growth (\\(g^*\\)) as the fundamental law of capitalism. This was the “normal” situation for most of the twentieth century. According to neoclassical economics, in this situation capitalism accumulates capital at the appropriate rate. However, neoclassical (or mainstream) economists have studied when this scenario might fail (for example, population ageing, incentives to accumulate wealth for retirement, so private pension schemes or replacing the welfare state with self-insurance mechanisms could be a bad idea in neoclassical economics). They predicted the consequences of the case where \\(r^*&lt;g^*\\), and provided the “Marxist” recipe that in this case, capitalism might need a large expansion of government to save itself. This condition, when \\(r^*&lt;g^*\\), is also the technical criterion that has been developed to assess whether an economy produces more savings than is required. In academic writing it is called “dynamic inefficiency”. “Dynamic” because it talks about how savings and capital build up over time (hence structural issue), and “inefficient” because the rate of building up capital (equivalently liquidity or savings) is too fast.\nBecause this is a new concept for most, let me try to explain it more simply. Dynamic inefficiency is an economic condition where the rate of capital accumulation exceeds the optimal level, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources and hindering long-term economic growth. This phenomenon is often observed in economies with a high savings rate, as excessive saving diverts resources away from current consumption and potential investment opportunities. This is why there is high chance ending in prolonged``liquidity or savings traps” as mentioned before.\nThe term “dynamic” emphasizes the time-dependent nature of this inefficiency. Capital accumulation, while beneficial for long-term growth, should occur at a pace that aligns with the economy’s productive capacity and demand for capital goods. When capital accumulation outpaces these factors, it signals a misallocation of how much we need to consume today vs the distant future, resulting in dynamic inefficiency.\nThe label “inefficient” highlights the sub-optimal allocation of resources caused by excessive savings. When savings exceed the optimal level, the economy as a whole prioritizes capital accumulation (savings) over current consumption and potential investment opportunities that could yield higher returns. This misallocation of resources hinders the economy’s ability to achieve a sustainable and balanced growth path.\nIn essence, dynamic inefficiency arises from a disconnect between the pace of capital accumulation and the economy’s ability to effectively utilize it. Excessive savings lead to an oversupply of capital, while the demand for capital goods lags behind. This imbalance creates a situation where resources are not optimally allocated, resulting in slower growth and diminished economic welfare.\nThe consequences of this equilibrium have long been discussed and understood in academia, including replicating ``Keynesian” ideas such as animal spirits and coordination failures, the build up of asset bubbles and increased financial fragility, the higher incentives of firms to buy their own stocks instead of investing and so on. In other words, fits well the stories describing the world before the pandemic. The paper of Geerolf has a nice review of what I discussed so far.\nNote, the fact that the identity is \\(r^*&lt;g^*\\) does not necessarily imply that long-term growth is “high”. However, because it differs from the usual case in which \\(r^*&gt;g^*\\), it has the interpretation that interest rates are low. Consider that there is a hypothetically ideal level of capital (academics call it the “Golden level or Rule”) against which actual capital can be compared. When actual capital exceeds this ideal, it is considered “too high” and accumulates at an unsustainable rate, causing interest rates (returns on capital) to fall to abnormally low levels, falling short of the economy’s long-term growth potentials.\nBecause I mentioned a few “stars,” it’s worth clarifying a few points. The confusion between what academics say and what policymakers, researchers, and market participants understand about what constitutes a low interest rate environment and the “stars” (that are usually discussed in public discussions and continue to grow in number) is so widespread that, as someone who has experienced all sides (academia, policy-making, markets), I begin to believe that each participant has invented its own school of thought about macroeconomics. The previous discussion of secular stagnation added more ambiguity to the situation. And I worry that many people will be very confused by these discussions.\nTo help clarify the situation. I am not referring to secular stagnation in what I have said. This isn’t necessary to the point I’m making about public debt, but it has the similar implications as the secular stagnation hypothesis. Secular stagnation is a hypothesis that says the economy is slowing down because there is not enough demand for investment. Technically, it poses the hypothesis that investments (\\(I\\)) are persistently lower than savings (\\(S\\)). Everything that stems from this hypothesis about interest rates and \\(r^*\\) are just conjectures influenced by the theories about excess savings that I previously discussed. This mixture can be found in Blanchard’s post, though his (mistimed due to the pandemic events) book more than clarifies the relevant concepts here.\nAnother difference that I want to highlight is that secular stagnation assumes that the imbalance is in the aggregate demand (which is I find it hard to believe, but easier to sell to governments), while the dynamic inefficiency criterion (\\(r^*&lt;g^*\\)) assumes that the imbalance is in the financial markets, which is more consistent with the “global savings glut”. So, secular stagnation you need more debt to clear aggregate demand, while the dynamic inefficiency you need more public debt to clear financial markets.\nFrom the more practical point of view, another limitation of the secular stagnation hypothesis is that cannot be really tested. After all, for countries with current account surpluses the condition \\(I&lt;S\\) always holds. Is this to say that China, whose \\(S\\) was always higher than \\(I\\), was in a long period of stagnation? Not at all. In contrast, the \\(r^∗&lt;g^∗\\) condition is a standard, well formalized, and understood criterion for excess savings with solid and mature theoretical foundations and with (academic) economists having long understood its consequences to a country’s long-term prospects and risks. Taking again China as an example, the empirical evidence suggests that China “today is unquestionably in a state of severe dynamic inefficiency, and the inefficient status is likely to continue in near future”. Hence, confirming what most people believe that China has been savings too much.\nThe savings glut and, by extension, the dynamic inefficiency hypothesis better explain the post-1980s reality, including the nature of the shocks that triggered excess savings, such as China’s one-child policy. In his book ``End of Alchemy”, former UK central banker Mervyn King provides an excellent account of these events and their (well-known) consequences:\n\n“… [In China] The desire to save was very strong. In the absence of a social safety net, households in China chose to save large proportions of their income to provide self-insurance in the event of unemployment or ill-health, and to finance retirement consumption. Such a high level of saving was exacerbated by the policy from 1980 of limiting most families to one child, making it difficult for parents to rely on their children to provide for them in retirement\n\n\n“… Keen though western consumers were on spending, their appetite was not strong enough to offset the even greater wish of emerging economies to save…The consequence was that in the world economy as a whole there was an excess saving, or in the vivid phrase of Ben Bernanke .. a ‘savings glut’…. This glut of saving pushed down long-term interest rates around the world…”\n\n\n“…with interest rates so low financial institutions and investors started to take on more and more risk, in an increasingly desperate hunt for higher returns without adequate compensation [ i.e. the risk premium between safe assets like UK or US government bond and other financial assets was very low] such behavior become known as “search for yield” …… Banks played their part in meeting this search for yield. They created a superstructure of even more complex financial instruments…. Both the complexity and the size of financial assets increased markedly. Low interest rates were encouraging households to bring forward spending from the future to the present [i.e. borrow]. That, too, could not continue indefinitely – and it didn’t.\n\n\n.. Central banks provided emergency loans, but these amounted to little more than holding a sheet in front of the Emperor – in this case the baking system – conceal his nakedness. It didn’t solve the underlying problem: banks needed not loans but injections of shareholders capital to reduce their extraordinarily high levels of leverage and to absorb losses from risky investments they made….The system staggered on for a year. Market confidence in banks ebbed and flowed. But on 15 September the long-established investment bank Lehman Brother failed…“\n\n\n\n\nIronically, in the 1980s, economists like Larry Summers convinced people that advanced economies could never be in a situation of excess savings. This not only consolidated the idea that crowding out private capital is always a bad idea but also contributed in designing fiscal frameworks where public debt was treated and seen more as an instrument for managing the economic cycle, along the lines of Keynesian economics. Hence, fiscal frameworks never build any capacity to foresee structural problems and view public debt as a tool treating excess savings. We also had all those reforms that the general public knows by the name “neo-liberal agenda”, which includes the advent of private pension systems, weakness of welfare state, and so on and helped accumulate extra buffer of savings. These issues were revisited after the Global Financial Crisis, but it was already too late.\nThe evidence from Summers et al. is too old to be useful now. So the question is whether we are still in this secular trajectory of excess savings, and hence if still makes sense to take this as the starting point in assessing US public debt. Some new evidence says so, confirming essentially Ben Bernanke’s hypothesis that the global economy has a savings glut problem. For reasons that I will explain later, when the global economy as a whole has a savings glut problem this mostly likely implies that the United States has it too. And, US public debt is key to fixing this problem.\nTo get a more “real-time” estimate of whether that starting point is still appropriate in the current circumstances, I’ll use the Holston, Laubach, Williams (HLW) dataset, which produces estimates for both \\(r^*\\) and \\(g^*\\), and are the closest proxies for assessing dynamic inefficiency in real-time. People use their estimates to look at \\(r^*\\), possibly because they are more preoccupied with the day-to-day developments in the economy and what monetary policy is doing. But If we want to consider whether we are still in the same secular trend in which the there is a tendency in producing more liquidity that can be absorbed, then we should be looking at the level of \\(r^*\\) in relation to \\(g^*\\). That is why I also think that in this case “how accurate” the estimation of \\(r^*\\) across different models is irrelevant; what matters is if the signal from these models are pointing to the same secular trajectory for the \\(r^*-g^*\\) gap.\nFigure 7 shows how the real interest rate \\(r^*\\), the long-term growth \\(g^*\\), and the gap between them (\\(r^*−g^∗\\)) have evolved over time, along with the debt-to-GDP ratio, since the late 1960s. The data shows that both \\(r^*\\) and \\(g^*\\) have declined over time, and this is not a coincidence. While other factors, such as productivity growth, may also play a role, the accumulation of capital (savings) is certainly a major driver and common factor affecting the \\(r^*−g^∗\\) gap. The consequences of excessive savings start to become visible in the early 1980s. When savings begin to accumulate more quickly, we first notice a decrease in the \\(r^*−g^∗\\) gap. As savings become excessively high as a result of even higher global saving rates, the gap becomes negative. In other words, as excess liquidity became too prevalent around the world, it began to show up in US data as well. The turning point for the sign reversal in \\(r^*-g^*\\) occurred around the mid-1990s, coinciding with the acceleration of globalization and the increased free movement of capital across the world. For example, the share of external debt as a percentage of total debt began to rise not only in the US, but also in countries like Greece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: The evolution of natural interest rates and long-term growth\n\n\n\nThe \\(r−g\\) gap in public finance and the \\(r^*−g^*\\) gap here are typically linked. A favorable r−g gap helps sustain public debt and the US government’s ability to maintain higher debt levels. This ability can help address the issue of excess savings. In simpler terms, US debt is most likely to be sustainable when the world saves more than it spends. The strong correlation between the \\(r−g\\) gap and excess savings is evident when we combine the evidence presented here with the CBO data discussed earlier. Both show negative r−g gaps after 2000. However, excess savings is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the public finance \\(r−g\\) gap to be negative. Therefore, without further investigation, it is unclear whether the CBO’s long-term projection of a negative \\(r−g\\) gap also indicates that excess savings are expected to persist. Nonetheless, the evidence here also shows that the \\(r^*−g^*\\) gap is still negative even after the pandemic, suggesting that the secular problem of excess savings is still persisting. Therefore, starting from this situation strengthens the case for assessing public debt in light of its ability to absorb excess liquidity and crowd out excess savings.\nThe evolution of public debt in relation to the \\(r^*-g^*\\) dynamics is also worth discussing. According to Figure 7, the crowding-in (in this case) effects of falling public debt supported high levels of \\(r^*-g^*\\) gap during the first period of falling public debt. During the early 1980s, when the \\(r^*-g^*\\) gap began to close, some early warning signs began to emerge. It was a time of greater economic integration and a greater influx of liquidity into the United States. It is probable that the rising debt levels during this period partially offset the excess liquidity, this time as a result of crowding out effects. But as \\(r^*-g^*\\) was close to zero, this level of public debt may have been close to optimal at the time (a situation referred to in academic writing as the Golden Rule). This observation, coincidentally or not, appears to be supported by some contemporary literature.\nIn the mid-1990s, excess liquidity began to build up. The subsequent debt adjustment may have been too extensive contributing to excess savings even domestically in the US. After 2000, things changed rapidly. Public debt and the \\(r^*−g^*\\) gap began moving in opposite directions, with debt rising and the gap declining, though it remained negative. The negative gap was further amplified by the Global Financial Crisis, despite the even faster rise in public debt. While correlations do not necessarily imply causation, and public debt could have crowd out capital, I believe that this clear disconnect between \\(r^*\\) and public debt, as well as between public debt and the \\(r^*−g^*\\) gap is due to two main reasons: (a) foreign lending and (b) excessive quantitative easing (QE).\nFirst, during this period there was a massive influx from abroad to the US helping financing the US deficit. Overlapping global shocks, such as the global financial crisis, the Eurozone crisis, Brexit, and trade wars have led to excess fiscal adjustments in some countries (e.g., the UK and the Eurozone), higher uncertainty, and enormous surpluses in others (e.g., Asian countries). This has created a strong demand for US Treasury bonds, which has helped to finance the US deficit. The large inflow of foreign lending, which the Federal Reserve was not considering when making its quantitative easing decisions, significantly reduced any crowding out effects. This allowed the natural rate of interest \\(r^*\\) to remain low, and this in turn might have also dragged down long-term growth rate \\(g^*\\).\nSecond, fiscal policy is often blamed for being too tight during this period, but I believe that the real issue was ultra-loose monetary policy. As I showed before, fiscal policy was overall expansionary. If monetary policy had not been so aggressive with enormous amounts of quantitative easing (QE), fiscal policy would have been able to crowd out more of the excessive savings in the US and abroad. Rising long-term real interest rates would have been all that was needed to lift all boats (inflation, recovery, growth, etc.). Crowding-out excess savings and private capital was essential for this and the Fed did not let it happen efficiently. Without a fiscal-monetary framework, monetary policy did not internalize the enormous global demand for US Treasuries and, by extension, the enormous amounts of foreign lending financing public debt. This distorted the proper functioning of public debt to absorb more of the excess savings and crowd out capital, so real interest rates could start rising again.\nWould fiscal policy have been that expansionary without such ultra-loose monetary policy? In my view, yes. That is because most of this expansion was due to the mechanical increase in the cost of social programs. In other words, population aging and its fiscal impact on the budget were colliding to increase real interest rates, but the Fed severely distorted a better outcome.\nFinally, closing the gap between the real interest rate (r*) and the economic growth rate (g*) does not necessarily mean that public debt will hurt growth. While there is evidence of the negative consequences of public debt on long-term growth, this evidence fails to distinguish between excess capital and non-excessive capital. Some new theoretical work also confirms this intuition. It is also masked by the fact that most of this evidence combines data from all countries and time periods, so the results are biased by periods of high population growth and no excess savings. Additionally, the evidence fails to show what happens to growth when public debt is used to finance social programs.\nIn addition, we should not forget history here. For instance, history has shown that a potential contributing factor to the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain was the towering levels of public debt (which at the time was financing wasteful wars). This debt crowded out excess capital, enabling the nobility to abandon low-return investments like agricultural improvements and switch to emerging and more productive sectors like textiles and iron. In that sense, China’s dominance might actually accelerate if more of its excess savings instead of financing US deficits are used to finance domestic investments and public expenditures – as the plan currently is set up.\nTherefore, until we are sure that long-term trends have substantially changed and the world, and by extension the US economy, is no longer living in an excess savings trajectory, the US public debt should be kept high.\n\n\n\nI mentioned before that it doesn’t really matter whether the world or the US itself has a savings glut issue. Here’s why. Figure 8 shows the global shares of budget and current account deficits for the US and other countries. The US current account deficit accounts for more than half of global current account deficits, and the US budget deficit is also large, accounting for close to 44% of the world’s total. To put it simply, the US is absorbing nearly two-thirds of global savings, with a significant proportion of this going to US budget deficit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Largest Current Account Deficit Countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Largest Budget Deficit Countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: US deficits (% World’s total)\n\n\n\nAlthough these numbers raise many other questions and expose some vulnerabilities, they also show that US fiscal policy is, in effect, the world’s fiscal policy. As long as the world as a whole continues to produce surpluses at a faster pace than the US produces deficits (a scenario that is not implausible given population aging, for example), US public debt is unlikely to have a significant impact on either domestic or global interest rates (\\(r^*\\)), or to crowd out a significant amount of capital (if at all in this case).\nFrom this perspective, US public debt could still be too low, and the years ahead could resemble the (the equally unhealthy as the ZIRP) period before the Global Financial Crisis. The fiscal policies of other countries also matter, especially China’s, and to some extent the UK’s, Japan’s and Germany’s. But the lion’s share of responsibility for leading the world to a more robust growth prospects currently falls on US fiscal policy.\n\n\n\nThe US public debt is rising, which is helping to absorb the world’s excess savings. Given long-term trends, increasing US public debt may be a good thing until there is evidence that this excess savings has been removed.\nPublic debt is not the only way to account for excess savings, but it is required if the global picture remains unchanged (i.e., same or worse welfare state, weak labour markets, hyper-globalization, further expansion of the private pension system, extreme wealth concentration, and so on). We can debate how best to spend this money and the mechanism to accomplish this, such as spending on public investments, causing some inflation to force the Fed to keep interest rates higher, financing climate change, or a combination of all of these, but being bold in mitigating the perpetual risk of excess savings within the financial system is not inherently harmful. High public debt in the United States can accomplish this by changing market incentives and discouraging excessive risk-taking behaviour. This, in turn, leads to a sustained period of strong global economic growth. However, achieving this would be contingent on three critical factors: foreign lending, domestic tax policies, and China’s fiscal framework. These factors are directly related to how much excess liquidity and private capital the US debt can accommodate, as well as the optimal debt level. Until we see a meaningful closing of the \\(r^* - g^*\\) gap The public debt in the United States is far from optimal.\nThis is not to say that some short-run adjustment is not required, but the current signals indicate that significant debt adjustments that would necessitate running primary surpluses are not required.\nKeeping US debt high until markets change their incentives would reduce the incentives to accumulate capital much faster than necessary and save too much. Of course, how quickly we reach that optimal point will be determined by other factors as well (e.g., slowing globalization, social reforms that reduce the incentives to save, etc.), but the US public debt is part of this equation and a countervailing force against saving too much."

    "title": "The Fed and Private Consumption (Wonkish)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The hawkishness of the Federal Reserve (Fed) is determined by how changes in interest rates affect consumer spending, which is the largest component of aggregate demand. The elasticity of intertemporal substitution is a forward-looking measure that can be used to assess the aggressiveness of monetary policy by capturing the sensitivity of private consumption to changes in interest rates. I show that the Fed’s recent projections imply a very tight monetary policy stance (tighter than the market expects) especially in the near term. However, the implied level of elasticity of intertemporal substitution is quite unusual compared to other empirical studies, suggesting that this may trigger strong income effects and inflation may not fall as quickly as the Fed is expecting. As a result, it appears that luck factors matter more for inflation dynamics, as neither the supply-side factors nor the indirect effects of higher interest rates (which appear more relevant empirically) are under the Fed’s direct control.\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral banks have begun their tightening cycle to bring an exceptionally high inflation rate down, and are committed to even more tightening if inflation remains high. In assessing the tightness of monetary policy, it is common to compare the policy rate (the rate at which banks lend to each other) to the size of inflation or the level of neutral interest rates, and to compare this distance across time. However, this approach does not tell us much about the expected drop in aggregate demand.\nMore importantly, comparisons across time are not very meaningful. For example, a 50 basis point increase in the policy rate might have a stronger impact today than it did 20-30 years ago, because a much larger number of people are now leveraged. Therefore, even if the distance between the policy rate and inflation looks larger (or smaller) between two different periods, such comparisons are inconsistent due to differences in the prevailing structure of the economy.\nhe Federal Reserve’s ability to control inflation is closely linked to how interest rates affect consumer spending. This is because consumer spending accounts for roughly 60% of aggregate demand, which is equivalent to GDP. Therefore, a supplementary (and perhaps more appropriate) way to assess the tightness of monetary policy is to look at the effects of interest rates on private consumption.\nThe short-term nominal interest rates, which are the Federal Reserve’s main tool for affecting aggregate demand, transmit to private consumption in two broad ways. The first is through a direct channel, which takes into account how interest rates alone affect consumption. The second is through an indirect channel, which only focuses on the second-order effects of interest rate changes on aggregate demand, namely the change in disposable income of households. It is important to note that the indirect effects emanate from the direct impact of the original interest rate change and are therefore a function of consumers’ response to rising interest rates.\nIn evaluating the right monetary policy stance, it is necessary to make judgments on two interdependent issues:\n\nHow the direct effects would affect consumption.\nWhether the transmission mechanism of monetary policy relies more on the direct or indirect channel.\n\nInappropriate judgments on the first issue would necessarily lead to misleading or fallacious judgments on the second. While the first issue may seem less controversial, the quantitative impact of monetary policy on private consumption is still ambiguous.\nIn this post, I will focus on the first issue. Clarifying this issue can help to bring more clarity when assessing monetary policy tightness. For example, if the direct effects are expected to be sufficiently strong, the fall in disposable income will contribute less to the drop in aggregate demand. Otherwise, the potential reliance on the indirect effects implies a more persistent inflation and uncertain outlook, and adds to the factors that the Federal Reserve needs to overcome, since such second-order effects are (together with the supply side factors) not under its direct control.\n\n\n\nThe effects of interest rates on consumption are a central part of macroeconomic theory. When interest rates rise, there are two main effects:\n\nThe substitution effect: Higher interest rates make it more expensive to consume now, so people tend to save more and consume less.\nThe income effect: Higher interest rates also increase the income that people earn from their savings, which can lead to increased consumption.\n\nThe overall effect of interest rates on consumption is ambiguous, and depends on the relative strength of the substitution and income effects. In general, the substitution effect is stronger for people who have lower incomes and less wealth, while the income effect is stronger for people who have higher incomes and more wealth.\nThe conventional view is that (on aggregate) higher interest rates reduce consumption, as the substitution effect outweighs the income effect. However, the size of the effect is uncertain, and depends on the distribution of income and wealth in the economy.\nOne way to measure the relative strength of the substitution and income effects is to look at the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS). The EIS is a measure of how responsive people are to changes in interest rates. A higher EIS means that people are more likely to save when interest rates rise, and consume less.\nIn the next section, I estimate the EIS based on the Fed’s forecasts. This will allow me to extract the implicit judgement that the Fed is making about the effects of interest rates on consumption.\n\n\n\nTo this end, I will use a conventional macroeconomic approach. This may not allow definite conclusions, but it works well as a proof of concept. Assuming that households are reasonably forward-looking, conventional macroeconomic theory likes to use the so-called Euler equation to study consumption dynamics. People may also be familiar with this equation through the CAMP model, which is used to study the relationship between business cycles and asset prices.\nThere are various versions of this equation, depending on the application. For the point I want to make here, a conventional approach is sufficient. In this case, and in order to link inflation, interest rates, consumption, income, and substitution effects, I would assume that aggregate consumption follows the rule below (See here or here for a simple example)\n\\[\nE_{t} \\Delta \\overline{ c_{t+1}}=\\sigma \\widehat{r_{t}}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\Delta \\overline{ c_{t+1}} = \\log(c_{t+1})-\\log(c_{t}) \\quad (\\text{real consumption growth})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\widehat{r_{t}} = \\log(r_{t})-\\log(r^*)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{and} \\quad r_{t} = i_{t}-\\pi_{t+1} \\quad ( \\text{real risk-free/fund rate with } r^* \\equiv \\text{long-run values})\n\\]\nThe parameter \\(\\sigma\\) is the so-called elasticity of intertemporal substitution, which controls the sensitivity of consumption growth to changes in interest rates1. The higher this value, the more sensitive consumption growth is to a change in interest rates. This parameter also controls the balance between the substitution and income effects. More specifically:\n\\[\n\\sigma\n\\begin{cases}\n&lt; 1 \\qquad \\text{Income Effect &gt; Substitution Effect} \\\\\n&gt; 1 \\qquad \\text{Income Effect &lt; Substitution Effect} \\\\\n= 1 \\qquad \\text{Income Effect = Substitution Effect}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nAn estimate of less than one implies that the income effect dominates the substitution effect and consumption tends to increase after an increase in interest rates. Conversely, when the substitution effect is greater than the income effect (\\(\\sigma &gt; 1\\)), higher interest rates encourage more savings and less borrowing, hence aggregate demand falls. There is also the third case where these two effects cancel each other out, so consumption is insensitive to interest rates. This is irrelevant in the short run, but not implausible in the long run.\nNote that the natural interest rate is a function of \\(\\sigma\\), which captures households’ desire to smooth consumption over time. For example, if consumers permanently change their consumption preferences (e.g. becoming more stingy) this affects the path of consumption and, by extension, the supply of savings, which is important for natural interest rates.\nIn the June statement, the Fed released the following projections:\n\n\n\nVariable\n2022\n2023\n2024\nLong-run\n\n\n\n\nreal GDP growth\n1.7\n1.7\n1.9\n1.8\n\n\nPCE Inflation\n5.2\n2.6\n2.2\n2\n\n\nFederal funds rate\n3.4\n3.4\n3.4\n2.5\n\n\n\nI use these projections to reverse engineer and uncover the parameter \\(\\sigma\\) based on the consumption rule above. As the Federal Reserve does not publish its projections for real consumption growth, I will use real GDP growth instead. In the data, real GDP growth and real consumption growth are strongly correlated (the correlation coefficient is roughly 0.90–0.99), so this approximation does little harm. Therefore, such forecasts imply that the EIS is:\n\n\n\n\n2022\n2023\n2024\n\n\n\n\nCentral Scenario\nN/A\n4.5\n5\n\n\n\nFor the year 2022, it was not possible to estimate \\(\\sigma\\), since mathematically, the interest rates were too low for the size of inflation, and therefore the logarithm was not defined. In general, the Fed’s central forecasts imply a rather stable \\(\\sigma \\approx 5\\) across the forecast years. Interestingly, this in turn implies that the Fed may need to raise interest rates by another 200 basis points by the end of 2022 in order to validate its assumption.\nThis evidence suggests that a) the Fed may be assuming that substitution effects outweigh income effects on the aggregate2, which is in line with conventional wisdom, but is also signalling that markets might be underestimating the probability for higher interest rates in the future.\n\n\n\nHowever, in the current context, the strength of the substitution effects, that is, the size of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS), also matters for the tightness of monetary policy. To get a sense of this, I used an excellent meta-analysis that collects more than 2,700 published estimates of the EIS across countries, with about half of them focusing on the United States. Based on this study, I show below the distribution of the EIS across countries, including the US. The red horizontal line is when the EIS equals 1, so values above this line indicate when the substitution effect dominates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe good news is that the Fed’s forecasts suggest that monetary policy is quite tight (more than the market assumes). This is because the estimated value of the elasticity of substitution, \\(\\sigma\\), lies in the range of extreme values. For the size of the substitution effects assumed here, the rise in interest rates implies a rather strong impact on consumption in the near term.\nThe bad news is that the Fed is quite likely to be wrong. The most likely values of \\(\\sigma\\) (see Figure) suggest that the income effect typically dominates. This means that consumption could still drop, but not as much as the Fed might be expecting. This is because the rich are likely to hold consumption firm, even if interest rates rise. Relative to the case where the substitution effects dominate, consumption takes a smaller hit in this case, but it takes a longer time to recover.\nThe ugly part is that central banks, including the Fed, have traditionally focused on aggregate outcomes. This was partly due to data limitations, as it was hard to identify distributional effects without large individual-level panels. But it also reflected the conventional view that monetary policy works largely through intertemporal substitution, which was thought to affect everyone in much the same way. Nevertheless, recent recent research is convincingly suggesting that monetary policy works largely through indirect effects. As I noted, income effects are likely to be empirically more relevant than the Fed might be assuming. Practically, this means that the lags of monetary policy might be too long to affect private consumption much.\n\n\n\nMy previous post did not aim to provide a comprehensive analysis. To simplify matters, I only focused on consumption-saving choices, taking into account the desire of consumers to smooth consumption over time. However, at times of heightened uncertainty, households may develop another motive for saving: precautionary savings. This is a way of insuring themselves against uncertain labor market prospects. A precautionary savings motive combined with pessimistic sentiment also contributes to a falling aggregate demand. Therefore, even if the Fed gets it wrong with the intertemporal substitution, uncertainty is on its side. All it takes is to spread the fear of recession and aggregate demand (and oil prices) will fall.\nWealth effects, that is the drop in consumption due to the fall in asset prices, is another important channel that affects private consumption. I did not discuss this here either, but I expect that such effects are already incorporated in the Fed’s latest forecasts. In principle, one could use the same strategy that I developed here to uncover what the Fed is expecting, but the consumption rule might need to be changed to Epstein-Zin preferences.\nOverall, however, it appears that luck factors are more important for inflation dynamics. Neither the supply side factors nor the indirect effects are under the Fed’s direct control."

    "text": "Central banks have begun their tightening cycle to bring an exceptionally high inflation rate down, and are committed to even more tightening if inflation remains high. In assessing the tightness of monetary policy, it is common to compare the policy rate (the rate at which banks lend to each other) to the size of inflation or the level of neutral interest rates, and to compare this distance across time. However, this approach does not tell us much about the expected drop in aggregate demand.\nMore importantly, comparisons across time are not very meaningful. For example, a 50 basis point increase in the policy rate might have a stronger impact today than it did 20-30 years ago, because a much larger number of people are now leveraged. Therefore, even if the distance between the policy rate and inflation looks larger (or smaller) between two different periods, such comparisons are inconsistent due to differences in the prevailing structure of the economy.\nhe Federal Reserve’s ability to control inflation is closely linked to how interest rates affect consumer spending. This is because consumer spending accounts for roughly 60% of aggregate demand, which is equivalent to GDP. Therefore, a supplementary (and perhaps more appropriate) way to assess the tightness of monetary policy is to look at the effects of interest rates on private consumption.\nThe short-term nominal interest rates, which are the Federal Reserve’s main tool for affecting aggregate demand, transmit to private consumption in two broad ways. The first is through a direct channel, which takes into account how interest rates alone affect consumption. The second is through an indirect channel, which only focuses on the second-order effects of interest rate changes on aggregate demand, namely the change in disposable income of households. It is important to note that the indirect effects emanate from the direct impact of the original interest rate change and are therefore a function of consumers’ response to rising interest rates.\nIn evaluating the right monetary policy stance, it is necessary to make judgments on two interdependent issues:\n\nHow the direct effects would affect consumption.\nWhether the transmission mechanism of monetary policy relies more on the direct or indirect channel.\n\nInappropriate judgments on the first issue would necessarily lead to misleading or fallacious judgments on the second. While the first issue may seem less controversial, the quantitative impact of monetary policy on private consumption is still ambiguous.\nIn this post, I will focus on the first issue. Clarifying this issue can help to bring more clarity when assessing monetary policy tightness. For example, if the direct effects are expected to be sufficiently strong, the fall in disposable income will contribute less to the drop in aggregate demand. Otherwise, the potential reliance on the indirect effects implies a more persistent inflation and uncertain outlook, and adds to the factors that the Federal Reserve needs to overcome, since such second-order effects are (together with the supply side factors) not under its direct control."

    "text": "The effects of interest rates on consumption are a central part of macroeconomic theory. When interest rates rise, there are two main effects:\n\nThe substitution effect: Higher interest rates make it more expensive to consume now, so people tend to save more and consume less.\nThe income effect: Higher interest rates also increase the income that people earn from their savings, which can lead to increased consumption.\n\nThe overall effect of interest rates on consumption is ambiguous, and depends on the relative strength of the substitution and income effects. In general, the substitution effect is stronger for people who have lower incomes and less wealth, while the income effect is stronger for people who have higher incomes and more wealth.\nThe conventional view is that (on aggregate) higher interest rates reduce consumption, as the substitution effect outweighs the income effect. However, the size of the effect is uncertain, and depends on the distribution of income and wealth in the economy.\nOne way to measure the relative strength of the substitution and income effects is to look at the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS). The EIS is a measure of how responsive people are to changes in interest rates. A higher EIS means that people are more likely to save when interest rates rise, and consume less.\nIn the next section, I estimate the EIS based on the Fed’s forecasts. This will allow me to extract the implicit judgement that the Fed is making about the effects of interest rates on consumption."

    "text": "To this end, I will use a conventional macroeconomic approach. This may not allow definite conclusions, but it works well as a proof of concept. Assuming that households are reasonably forward-looking, conventional macroeconomic theory likes to use the so-called Euler equation to study consumption dynamics. People may also be familiar with this equation through the CAMP model, which is used to study the relationship between business cycles and asset prices.\nThere are various versions of this equation, depending on the application. For the point I want to make here, a conventional approach is sufficient. In this case, and in order to link inflation, interest rates, consumption, income, and substitution effects, I would assume that aggregate consumption follows the rule below (See here or here for a simple example)\n\\[\nE_{t} \\Delta \\overline{ c_{t+1}}=\\sigma \\widehat{r_{t}}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\Delta \\overline{ c_{t+1}} = \\log(c_{t+1})-\\log(c_{t}) \\quad (\\text{real consumption growth})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\widehat{r_{t}} = \\log(r_{t})-\\log(r^*)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{and} \\quad r_{t} = i_{t}-\\pi_{t+1} \\quad ( \\text{real risk-free/fund rate with } r^* \\equiv \\text{long-run values})\n\\]\nThe parameter \\(\\sigma\\) is the so-called elasticity of intertemporal substitution, which controls the sensitivity of consumption growth to changes in interest rates1. The higher this value, the more sensitive consumption growth is to a change in interest rates. This parameter also controls the balance between the substitution and income effects. More specifically:\n\\[\n\\sigma\n\\begin{cases}\n&lt; 1 \\qquad \\text{Income Effect &gt; Substitution Effect} \\\\\n&gt; 1 \\qquad \\text{Income Effect &lt; Substitution Effect} \\\\\n= 1 \\qquad \\text{Income Effect = Substitution Effect}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nAn estimate of less than one implies that the income effect dominates the substitution effect and consumption tends to increase after an increase in interest rates. Conversely, when the substitution effect is greater than the income effect (\\(\\sigma &gt; 1\\)), higher interest rates encourage more savings and less borrowing, hence aggregate demand falls. There is also the third case where these two effects cancel each other out, so consumption is insensitive to interest rates. This is irrelevant in the short run, but not implausible in the long run.\nNote that the natural interest rate is a function of \\(\\sigma\\), which captures households’ desire to smooth consumption over time. For example, if consumers permanently change their consumption preferences (e.g. becoming more stingy) this affects the path of consumption and, by extension, the supply of savings, which is important for natural interest rates.\nIn the June statement, the Fed released the following projections:\n\n\n\nVariable\n2022\n2023\n2024\nLong-run\n\n\n\n\nreal GDP growth\n1.7\n1.7\n1.9\n1.8\n\n\nPCE Inflation\n5.2\n2.6\n2.2\n2\n\n\nFederal funds rate\n3.4\n3.4\n3.4\n2.5\n\n\n\nI use these projections to reverse engineer and uncover the parameter \\(\\sigma\\) based on the consumption rule above.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This document presents a structured discussion on key economic concepts such as the balance of trade, the interaction between exchange rates and trade balances, the role of dollar invoicing in weakening the traditional link between exchange rates and trade, and how these dynamics influence inflation. The conversation includes key policy implications drawn from these concepts, providing a comprehensive overview for understanding these important areas of economics.\n\n\n\nThe balance of trade refers to the difference between the value of a country’s exports and imports. It is a core component of the broader balance of payments (BoP), which tracks all economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world.\nA trade surplus occurs when a country exports more goods and services than it imports, resulting in net inflows of foreign currency. Conversely, a trade deficit occurs when a country imports more than it exports, leading to net outflows of currency.\nUnderstanding a country’s balance of trade is crucial for evaluating its economic health and its position in the global economy. Consistent trade deficits can be a sign of an over-reliance on imports, while persistent trade surpluses may indicate strong global competitiveness.\n\n\nExchange rates and trade balances are interrelated in a dynamic feedback loop. The exchange rate influences the trade balance, and vice versa.\n\n\nWhen a country’s currency depreciates (becomes weaker), its exports become cheaper for foreign buyers, while imports become more expensive for domestic consumers. This tends to improve the trade balance by increasing export demand and reducing imports. On the other hand, currency appreciation (a stronger currency) makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive, which worsens the trade balance.\n\n\n\nA country’s trade balance affects its currency value. When a country runs a trade surplus, there is increased demand for its currency as foreign buyers need it to pay for exports. This demand can lead to currency appreciation. Conversely, a trade deficit reduces demand for the domestic currency, leading to depreciation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA key factor complicating the traditional exchange rate-trade balance relationship is dollar invoicing, where goods and services are priced in U.S. dollars (USD) regardless of the countries involved. Dollar invoicing is prevalent in many sectors, such as commodities (e.g., oil), global trade of manufactured goods, and financial services.\nUnder dollar invoicing, the prices of exports and imports remain fixed in USD, even if a country’s exchange rate changes. This reduces the effectiveness of currency depreciation as a tool to improve trade balance since the pass-through effect is weakened. A weaker local currency no longer immediately boosts export competitiveness because the export prices, fixed in dollars, do not change for foreign buyers.\nOn the import side, when a local currency weakens, the cost of USD-priced imports rises in local currency terms, leading to higher import prices and driving domestic inflation. This is especially critical for essential imports like oil or raw materials, where price increases are quickly felt throughout the economy.\n\n\n\nThe balance of trade has significant effects on a country’s inflation levels, primarily through its influence on import prices. Inflation rises when a country faces higher import costs, especially for goods priced in USD. This is particularly relevant for countries that run persistent trade deficits and rely heavily on imports for essential goods like energy and food.\nA weaker local currency can lead to imported inflation, where the cost of imports rises in local currency terms, leading to higher prices for consumers and businesses. This inflationary pressure is especially acute in countries that import a large share of their consumption. Conversely, when a country runs a trade surplus, export-led growth can support price stability. However, rapid export growth can lead to demand-pull inflation, where increased demand pushes up domestic prices.\n\n\n\nThe complexities of trade balances, exchange rates, and dollar invoicing have broad implications for economic policy. Policymakers must consider various strategies to manage the impact of these dynamics.\n\n\nFor countries facing rising import costs due to currency depreciation, inflation control becomes a top priority. Central banks may need to tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates to manage inflation, but this could slow economic growth. Meanwhile, exchange rate interventions, such as accumulating foreign exchange reserves or engaging in currency swaps, can help stabilize the currency.\n\n\n\nFiscal policy can play a role in mitigating the impact of trade imbalances and inflation. Governments can encourage import substitution industries to reduce reliance on USD-priced imports and promote domestic production. They can also implement subsidies to shield vulnerable populations from rising import prices, particularly for essential goods like food and energy.\nIn the long term, countries should invest in economic diversification to reduce their exposure to global price fluctuations. This includes developing sectors that are less reliant on USD-invoiced goods, improving domestic production, and enhancing export competitiveness.\n\n\n\nCountries can benefit from international coordination on currency stability and trade policies. Regional trade agreements that use local currencies, rather than the U.S. dollar, can help shield economies from currency volatility. Additionally, promoting the use of alternative reserve currencies, such as the euro or yuan, could diversify global trade away from a single-currency system.\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between the balance of trade, exchange rates, dollar invoicing, and inflation is complex and interconnected. Policymakers must carefully navigate these dynamics to manage their impact on the domestic economy, particularly in terms of inflation control, trade balance management, and currency stability. Through a combination of monetary, fiscal, and structural reforms, countries can better position themselves to handle the challenges posed by a global economy dominated by dollar invoicing and fluctuating exchange rates."

    "title": "How Changing Populations Shape the Global Economy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction: The Demographic Divide\nAs the global population ages in advanced economies while remaining youthful in many low-income and emerging markets, the implications for investment, growth, and financial stability are profound. Understanding how these demographic shifts affect key economic variables is crucial for policymakers, businesses, and investors alike.\n\n\nLabor Force and Productivity: The Impact of Aging Populations\nIn advanced economies, shrinking labor forces are becoming a common reality. The decreasing number of working-age individuals results in lower productivity growth, which discourages businesses from making large-scale investments. This demographic shift, while unique to older populations, has far-reaching consequences on overall economic activity.\n\n\nChanging Consumption Patterns and Investment Demand\nOlder populations consume differently, spending more on healthcare and less on durable goods or housing. This shift alters the structure of economic demand, reducing the need for capital-intensive industries and further weakening the incentive for businesses to invest in growth-driving sectors. In contrast, younger populations fuel demand for goods, housing, and infrastructure, spurring investment in emerging markets.\n\n\nInterest Rates, Savings, and Investment Dynamics\nIn aging economies, higher savings combined with weak investment opportunities lead to lower interest rates. While this environment theoretically encourages borrowing, businesses remain reluctant due to slow demand growth. Conversely, younger economies with high investment needs often experience upward pressure on interest rates, potentially attracting capital inflows but also posing risks to financial stability.\n\n\nDemographics and Monetary Policy: A New Challenge for Central Banks\nDemographic changes directly affect the conduct of monetary policy, particularly in aging economies. As populations age, central banks face disinflationary pressures due to reduced consumption and investment demand. With lower inflation, central banks may need to adopt more accommodative monetary policies, including keeping interest rates at historically low levels for prolonged periods to stimulate demand.\nIn contrast, younger economies with growing labor forces and high consumption and investment demand may experience inflationary pressures. Central banks in these regions may need to adopt more aggressive interest rate hikes to prevent overheating economies. Managing the divergence in demographic trends between advanced and emerging economies poses a challenge for global monetary policy coordination, as different regions require vastly different approaches.\n\n\nDemographics and Fiscal Policy: Balancing the Public Budget\nDemographics also place a significant strain on fiscal policy, particularly in aging economies. As the population ages, governments face increased expenditure on pensions, healthcare, and social services. With more retirees depending on fewer working-age taxpayers, fiscal burdens rise, leading to higher budget deficits and public debt levels.\nIn advanced economies, this growing dependency ratio forces governments to either increase taxes or cut spending on other critical sectors such as education, infrastructure, and research, creating a fiscal squeeze. Additionally, the higher social spending required by an aging population may crowd out public investment, further limiting long-term economic growth prospects.\nYounger economies, on the other hand, face a different set of fiscal challenges. While they may benefit from a demographic dividend due to a larger working-age population, this also comes with an increased need for investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Governments in these economies must navigate the delicate balance between leveraging this demographic opportunity and managing budgetary pressures, ensuring that short-term spending does not lead to unsustainable debt levels.\n\n\nGlobal Trade and Capital Flows: Imbalances and Risks\nDemographic shifts also reshape global trade dynamics. Aging economies may run current account surpluses due to higher savings and lower consumption, while younger economies may face deficits due to increased investment demand. These imbalances influence global capital flows, potentially leading to financial instability if not carefully managed.\n\n\nLong-Term Growth: The Future of Global Economies\nLooking ahead, advanced economies are likely to see slower potential output as a result of aging populations, while younger economies have the opportunity for faster growth—if they can meet the challenges of rising demand for investment. The evolving demographic landscape will define the economic strategies of both developed and emerging markets in the coming decades.\n\n\nConclusion: Adapting to Demographic Realities\nDemographic trends are reshaping the global economy in profound ways. As populations age in advanced economies and remain youthful in emerging markets, the resulting changes in labor markets, consumption, fiscal policy, investment, and monetary policy will challenge traditional economic models. Successfully navigating these shifts will require innovative policies and adaptive strategies for a sustainable future."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Public debt is a cornerstone issue for both economists and policymakers. But beyond the question of whether a government should borrow more or less, there’s a deeper puzzle: how does public debt influence r-star, the natural rate of interest? Understanding this dynamic is key to grasping the long-term interplay between fiscal policy and macroeconomic stability.\nIn this post, we’ll break down the various channels through which public debt shapes r-star and explore why maintaining debt sustainability is essential to keeping r-star in check. Let’s dive into the world where fiscal policy and interest rates converge!\n\n\n\nBefore tackling the intricate relationship between public debt and r-star, let’s clarify what r-star represents. It’s the real interest rate that keeps the economy on an even keel—neither stimulating nor restraining growth. Essentially, it’s where savings and investment reach equilibrium, maintaining stable inflation and full employment. r-star is a fundamental anchor for monetary policy.\nBut how does government borrowing affect this seemingly delicate balance?\n\n\n\nTo comprehend the link between public debt and r-star, we first need to understand the debt sustainability condition. It serves as a rule of thumb for ensuring that a government’s debt doesn’t spiral out of control, causing economic upheaval.\nMathematically, debt sustainability is framed like this:\n\\(\\Delta d_t \\leq (r - g) d_{t-1}\\)\nWhere:\n- \\(d_t\\) = debt-to-GDP ratio\n- \\(r\\) = real interest rate (or the cost of borrowing)\n- \\(g\\) = real GDP growth rate\nThis formula tells us that for debt to be sustainable, the growth rate of debt should not exceed the difference between the interest rate and the GDP growth rate. If the debt sustainability condition holds, markets remain confident in a government’s ability to manage its debt, keeping long-term interest rates stable. But if it fails, that confidence falters, potentially causing long-term interest rates, including r-star, to rise.\n\n\n\nNow let’s explore the primary channels by which public debt influences r-star. These mechanisms are crucial to understanding how government borrowing affects the broader economy.\n\n\nExcessive government borrowing can lead to crowding out, where the government competes with private firms for available capital. As a result, interest rates rise, making it more expensive for businesses to borrow and invest. This reduction in private investment distorts the savings-investment balance, pushing r-star upward.\nHowever, when debt is kept within sustainable bounds, the crowding-out effect is limited, leaving r-star more stable.\n\n\n\nInvestors are keenly aware of a government’s debt levels. If they perceive the debt as risky, they demand a higher risk premium—essentially compensation for taking on additional risk. This raises long-term interest rates, feeding directly into a higher r-star.\nWhen debt remains sustainable, market confidence keeps risk premiums low, allowing r-star to align with underlying economic conditions rather than risk perceptions.\n\n\n\nHigh debt often creates expectations that future governments will need to adjust fiscal policy, likely through tax hikes or spending cuts. Such expectations can influence behavior: households and businesses may start saving more in anticipation of harder times, driving down r-star.\nOn the other hand, if debt is well managed, expectations of fiscal tightening are subdued, keeping r-star tied to real economic drivers like productivity growth.\n\n\n\nSustainable debt levels afford governments greater fiscal policy flexibility. In times of economic downturn, they can use fiscal tools to stimulate demand without spooking markets. This flexibility can smooth fluctuations in r-star, helping stabilize the economy.\nConversely, high debt constrains fiscal maneuverability. With fewer tools at their disposal, governments might see r-star fall as growth expectations sour.\n\n\n\nIn today’s interconnected financial world, public debt in major economies can affect global capital flows. When markets perceive debt in large economies as risky, investors demand higher returns, pushing global interest rates higher. This global crowding-out effect elevates r-star internationally.\nHowever, sustainable debt in key economies can help stabilize global interest rates, anchoring r-star worldwide.\n\n\n\n\nPublic debt has a significant, multifaceted impact on r-star—the natural rate of interest. Whether through crowding out, risk premiums, or fiscal expectations, government borrowing can either push r-star higher or keep it stable. The key to managing this delicate balance lies in maintaining debt sustainability. When governments borrow responsibly, the economy’s natural interest rate remains grounded in fundamental factors like productivity and demographics, rather than debt-driven risks.\nIn the end, the relationship between public debt and r-star underscores the broader importance of prudent fiscal policy. By carefully managing debt, governments can maintain a stable r-star, fostering long-term economic growth without letting borrowing costs spiral out of control."

    "section": "",
    "text": "If capitalism is meant to be the engine of efficiency and prosperity, why does it often feel like we’re riding a roller coaster, where the highs are euphoric, but the lows leave us hanging? The answer lies in something economists call the theory of incomplete financial markets. It’s not just a technical concept—it’s a lens through which we can understand why capitalism, left to its own devices, sometimes leaves people behind and why government intervention is not just helpful but necessary.\nLet’s break it down in plain terms: in a complete market, we would all have access to financial tools to insure ourselves against every possible risk or uncertainty. Job loss? There’s an asset for that. Sudden illness? Covered. Economic downturn? No problem, the markets have us all hedged.\nIn this ideal world, people could smoothly navigate life’s financial risks without worrying too much. Every choice you make, from how much you save to how much you invest, would be optimized. No one would ever be worse off because they were blindsided by a risk they couldn’t predict. In technical terms, this means we’d achieve Pareto efficiency—an allocation of resources where no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. Sounds perfect, right?\n\n\nBut here’s the rub: in the real world, we don’t have markets for everything. Incomplete markets are our reality, where many of life’s biggest risks are uninsurable, either because it’s too difficult to create financial products for them, or because doing so would be far too expensive or complicated.\nLet’s take an example. Imagine you’re a middle-class worker trying to save for retirement. Ideally, you’d want to insure yourself against losing your job, future health expenses, or even a stock market crash that could decimate your savings. But guess what? Not all of these risks are easily insured. In fact, many of them aren’t. Job loss insurance is patchy at best, health costs can spiral out of control, and if the market crashes, you’re left scrambling with little recourse.\nWithout the right tools to hedge against these risks, people tend to over-save “just in case” or under-consume because they’re unsure about future income. This behavior is known as precautionary saving—people save more than they normally would to protect themselves against risks they can’t insure. This leads to suboptimal decisions—not just for individuals, but for the whole economy.\nIn asset pricing, this means that investors demand higher risk premiums for assets because they can’t hedge all their risks. This, in turn, distorts how assets are valued and creates market inefficiencies. If financial markets were complete, we would see much more stable prices and a more even spread of risk across society. But in incomplete markets, risks are concentrated among those least able to bear them.\n\n\nA more subtle problem arises from coordination failures. Incomplete markets can lead to situations where individuals’ actions, while rational on their own, result in suboptimal outcomes for everyone. Think of a recession: if individuals expect the economy to worsen, they might cut back on spending and increase saving as a precaution. This makes sense for each person, but when everyone does it simultaneously, it leads to a sharp drop in aggregate demand, causing the economy to slow further.\nThis creates a feedback loop: as demand falls, firms cut back on production, leading to job losses, which in turn makes people save even more, worsening the recession. The failure to coordinate actions exacerbates the very risks individuals were trying to protect against.\nIn this sense, incomplete markets not only force individuals into precautionary behavior, but they also magnify economic downturns through self-fulfilling crises—where everyone’s attempt to insure themselves against a downturn creates the downturn itself.\n\n\n\n\nThis brings us to Adam Smith, the father of classical economics, and his famous concept of the “invisible hand.” According to Smith, individuals, acting in their own self-interest, will naturally lead to outcomes that are beneficial for society as a whole. The market, through this invisible hand, would allocate resources efficiently, maximizing social welfare without the need for central planning or government intervention.\nWhile Smith’s ideas were revolutionary, the theory of incomplete markets challenges the very foundation of this thinking. The invisible hand works well only when markets are complete—when individuals can trade and insure against every possible risk. In such a world, private actions would indeed lead to socially optimal outcomes. But in the real world of incomplete markets, where many risks remain uninsurable, the invisible hand falters.\nHere’s why:\n\nPrecautionary Savings Distort Efficiency: Incomplete markets force individuals to save more than they would in a world with complete markets because they cannot fully insure against future risks. This means that resources that could be used for consumption or investment are instead stockpiled in precautionary savings. While this is rational behavior for individuals, it leads to inefficient outcomes for society as a whole.\nCoordination Failures: Smith’s invisible hand assumes that individual decisions, even if made independently, will aggregate to benefit the broader economy. But in the case of incomplete markets, individuals’ attempts to protect themselves (such as cutting back on spending during a downturn) actually exacerbate the very problems they are trying to avoid. This creates coordination failures where the collective outcome is far worse than what individuals intend.\nInequality and Concentration of Risks: Smith’s model doesn’t account for the fact that incomplete markets often concentrate risks among the least wealthy. Incomplete markets mean that wealthier individuals, who have more access to financial tools, can hedge against risks more effectively, while poorer individuals are left more exposed. This exacerbates inequality, creating a system where the invisible hand works primarily for those already well-off, leaving others behind.\n\nIn short, Adam Smith was right to celebrate the power of self-interest and decentralized decision-making, but his model of capitalism assumes a world of complete markets. The real world, however, is filled with missing markets, uninsurable risks, and coordination failures that hinder efficient outcomes.\n\n\n\nOn a macroeconomic level, incomplete markets amplify the booms and busts of the economy. When recessions hit, many households can’t fully insure themselves against unemployment or falling income. Their response? Cut back on spending, creating a vicious cycle where demand falls even further, deepening the downturn. This isn’t just a personal problem—it’s an economy-wide one. When millions of people pull back at the same time, the economy grinds to a halt.\nMeanwhile, wealthier individuals or firms with more access to financial markets can weather these downturns better. They’re able to hedge against certain risks and even take advantage of market conditions. This contributes to growing inequality because those with more wealth and access to financial tools thrive, while those without are left more vulnerable.\n\n\n\nCapitalism’s beauty lies in its ability to allocate resources efficiently, but only under ideal conditions. The incomplete markets theory exposes a critical flaw: when markets don’t exist for certain risks, the system doesn’t function efficiently. People and businesses make suboptimal decisions, social welfare suffers, and inequality worsens. The more risks we can’t insure against, the worse these inefficiencies become.\nThis is why capitalism, on its own, doesn’t work. Without mechanisms to insure against risks, the promise of “market efficiency” is broken. People are left to fend for themselves against risks that they have no way of preparing for or managing. The system, in other words, is incomplete. And that’s where government comes in.\n\n\n\nContrary to the idea that government and capitalism are at odds, the truth is that government plays an essential role in making capitalism work better. Think of it as providing the safety net that catches what the markets can’t.\n\nPublic Insurance: When private markets fail to offer insurance against certain risks (like unemployment or healthcare costs), the government steps in with programs like unemployment benefits and social security. This doesn’t just help individuals; it stabilizes the economy by ensuring that people continue spending and investing, even in tough times.\nRedistribution: Through taxation and social welfare programs, governments can mitigate the inequality that incomplete markets exacerbate. By redistributing wealth from those who have more to those who are more vulnerable to uninsurable risks, governments help smooth the playing field.\nMacroeconomic Stabilization: During economic downturns, the government can use fiscal policy (like stimulus spending) and monetary policy (like lowering interest rates) to prop up demand when private markets are in freefall. This helps prevent recessions from spiraling out of control.\nMarket Innovation: Governments can also promote the development of new financial instruments that help fill in the gaps. By encouraging innovation in financial markets, governments can help “complete” the market and give individuals more tools to manage risks.\n\n\n\n\nThe theory of incomplete financial markets shows us that capitalism is not a self-sufficient machine. It can create enormous wealth and drive innovation, but it leaves cracks in the foundation—cracks that can grow into deep fissures if left unaddressed. Without government intervention to fill in these gaps, the risks that capitalism can’t manage pile up, leading to inefficiencies, inequality, and crises.\nCapitalism needs a partner, and that partner is government. Far from being a hindrance, the right kinds of government intervention can make markets more complete, more efficient, and—most importantly—more just. A world where everyone can manage the risks they face is a world where the economy works better for everyone.\nSo, the next time you hear someone touting capitalism as a flawless system, remind them: Capitalism only works if we complete the picture. And for that, we need a strong safety net, intelligent regulation, and a government that understands its role in making the markets work better for all of us."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Have you ever wondered why central banks are obsessed with interest rates? Or how their mysterious decisions ripple through the economy, affecting everything from the price of your morning coffee to the value of your home? If so, you’re in the right place.\nMonetary policy is like a maestro conducting an orchestra. Each instrument (interest rates, asset prices, the banking system) plays a role in creating harmony—or chaos—in the economy. In this blog post, we’ll break down the different ways monetary policy impacts your life, and why understanding it could be your ticket to navigating the economy like a pro.\n\n\n\nWhen the economy isn’t performing the way it should—too much inflation or not enough growth—central banks step in. They have a variety of tools to influence the economy, like adjusting interest rates, controlling the yield curve, and even creating new money (yes, helicopter money is a thing!).\nBut how do these tools work their magic?\n\n\nThink of interest rates as the price tag on borrowing money. When central banks lower interest rates, loans for everything from homes to new business ventures get cheaper. With lower borrowing costs, people are more likely to spend, and businesses are more likely to invest.\nSounds simple, right? Well, it gets better: Lower rates can even make saving less attractive. Who wants to park money in a bank account that earns next to nothing in interest? The result? People spend more, boosting demand and getting the economy moving again. But, of course, if inflation gets too high, the central bank hits the brakes by raising interest rates to cool things down.\n\n\n\nEver made a decision based on what you expect to happen? The same thing applies to businesses and consumers when it comes to economic conditions. If people expect prices to rise (inflation), they might rush to buy goods now, driving up demand and—ironically—causing even more inflation!\nCentral banks know this. By guiding expectations about inflation and future interest rates (through speeches or policy decisions), they can influence how people and businesses behave today. When they can calm inflation fears, they stabilize the economy. It’s like the psychological side of monetary policy—mind games with a purpose.\n\n\n\nEver wondered why credit cards or loans are suddenly easier to get when the economy is strong? This is where the credit channel comes in. When interest rates fall, banks find it cheaper to lend money, and that flood of credit boosts spending and investment.\nIt’s a chain reaction: businesses take out loans to expand, hire more people, and pay higher wages. Consumers borrow to buy homes and cars, spend more, and voila! The economy picks up momentum. The opposite happens when the central bank tightens lending conditions to cool an overheating economy.\n\n\n\nEver noticed how people seem more willing to splurge when their home value goes up or their stock portfolio is soaring? That’s the wealth effect at work. When asset prices rise—whether it’s stocks or real estate—people feel wealthier and tend to spend more. And when consumer spending rises, the whole economy benefits.\nThis is one reason why central banks are keen to keep financial markets stable. If stock prices or real estate values plummet, the opposite happens—people tighten their belts, demand falls, and the economy can slip into a recession.\n\n\n\nFinally, there’s the exchange rate channel. Imagine you’re traveling abroad and suddenly, your local currency buys you more goods. It feels great, right? The same thing happens in international trade. When a central bank lowers interest rates, it can make the domestic currency less attractive to foreign investors, who will seek higher returns elsewhere. The currency depreciates, and that’s good news for exporters—domestic goods become cheaper for foreign buyers, boosting sales and helping the economy.\n\n\n\n\nWhen interest rates hit rock bottom (aka the zero lower bound), central banks have to get creative. They can’t just keep cutting rates below zero without causing chaos in the financial system. So, they pull out the unconventional tools.\n\n\nImagine you’re trying to buy a house, and long-term mortgage rates are stubbornly high—even though the central bank has slashed short-term interest rates. This is where Yield Curve Control (YCC) comes in. By directly targeting longer-term rates (like 10-year bonds), central banks can ensure that borrowing costs stay low across the board, making it easier for businesses and consumers to get affordable loans.\n\n\n\nQuantitative Easing (QE) might sound like a complicated term, but it’s essentially about pumping money into the economy by buying up government bonds or even corporate debt. This extra demand lowers long-term interest rates and pushes investors into riskier assets (like stocks), lifting asset prices and creating the wealth effect we mentioned earlier.\nThe idea? With more money sloshing around, banks lend more, businesses invest, and the economy picks up steam.\n\n\n\nThink of helicopter money as the most direct and dramatic tool: Instead of influencing the economy through lending or asset prices, the central bank (in coordination with the government) simply gives people money. This direct injection boosts consumer spending almost immediately. But it’s risky—it can lead to inflation if there’s too much cash chasing too few goods.\n\n\n\n\nFew things illustrate the power of monetary policy better than the housing market. Mortgages are closely tied to long-term interest rates, so when the central bank lowers rates—or introduces QE or YCC—mortgage rates drop. Lower rates make housing more affordable, driving up demand and pushing home prices higher.\nThis creates a positive feedback loop: rising home prices make homeowners feel richer (thanks to the wealth effect), and they spend more, boosting the economy even further. In short, housing isn’t just a place to live—it’s one of the economy’s most important gears.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, monetary policy isn’t just abstract theory. It’s a powerful force that affects your everyday life—from the price of groceries to the interest rate on your credit card or mortgage. Understanding how these transmission mechanisms work can give you a clearer picture of why central banks do what they do and how you might want to respond.\nSo next time you hear that the central bank is adjusting rates or embarking on a new round of QE, you’ll know what it means for you, your wallet, and the broader economy.\n\n\n\n\nThe real magic of monetary policy is that it works differently depending on the economic context. During boom times, central banks focus on raising rates to prevent overheating. But when the economy falters, unconventional tools like QE and YCC come to the rescue. And in extreme cases, helicopter money can provide a direct boost to demand.\nThe key takeaway? The phase of the business cycle and the specific needs of each country determine which tool is most effective. But whatever the tool, one thing is clear: monetary policy shapes the world around us in more ways than you might imagine."

    "text": "Think of interest rates as the price tag on borrowing money. When central banks lower interest rates, loans for everything from homes to new business ventures get cheaper. With lower borrowing costs, people are more likely to spend, and businesses are more likely to invest.\nSounds simple, right? Well, it gets better: Lower rates can even make saving less attractive. Who wants to park money in a bank account that earns next to nothing in interest? The result? People spend more, boosting demand and getting the economy moving again. But, of course, if inflation gets too high, the central bank hits the brakes by raising interest rates to cool things down."

    "text": "Ever made a decision based on what you expect to happen? The same thing applies to businesses and consumers when it comes to economic conditions. If people expect prices to rise (inflation), they might rush to buy goods now, driving up demand and—ironically—causing even more inflation!\nCentral banks know this. By guiding expectations about inflation and future interest rates (through speeches or policy decisions), they can influence how people and businesses behave today. When they can calm inflation fears, they stabilize the economy. It’s like the psychological side of monetary policy—mind games with a purpose."

    "text": "Ever wondered why credit cards or loans are suddenly easier to get when the economy is strong? This is where the credit channel comes in. When interest rates fall, banks find it cheaper to lend money, and that flood of credit boosts spending and investment.\nIt’s a chain reaction: businesses take out loans to expand, hire more people, and pay higher wages. Consumers borrow to buy homes and cars, spend more, and voila! The economy picks up momentum. The opposite happens when the central bank tightens lending conditions to cool an overheating economy."

    "text": "Ever noticed how people seem more willing to splurge when their home value goes up or their stock portfolio is soaring? That’s the wealth effect at work. When asset prices rise—whether it’s stocks or real estate—people feel wealthier and tend to spend more. And when consumer spending rises, the whole economy benefits.\nThis is one reason why central banks are keen to keep financial markets stable. If stock prices or real estate values plummet, the opposite happens—people tighten their belts, demand falls, and the economy can slip into a recession."

    "text": "Finally, there’s the exchange rate channel. Imagine you’re traveling abroad and suddenly, your local currency buys you more goods. It feels great, right? The same thing happens in international trade. When a central bank lowers interest rates, it can make the domestic currency less attractive to foreign investors, who will seek higher returns elsewhere. The currency depreciates, and that’s good news for exporters—domestic goods become cheaper for foreign buyers, boosting sales and helping the economy."
