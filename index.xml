<p><em>For some time, the United States’ fiscal policy has been expansionary, resulting in an increase in public debt. The recent pandemic shock added another record amount of public debt, raising concerns about whether the US public debt is too high and thus unsustainable.

On the contrary, the fact that the US public debt has been rising for some time is actually a good thing considering the prevailing fundamentals of secular trends.</em></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The US public debt has reached about 100% of GDP, and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data">projects</a> that it will continue to rise if the US government continues to accumulate deficits (Figure&nbsp;1). This raises concerns about the sustainability of public debt and the US fiscal policy more generally. Unsustainable US public debt could crack the entire financial system, with devastating consequences for the global economy. All of this has led to the (false) perception that US fiscal policy is “reckless” and government debt is out of control. In this post, I will give a quick overview of US fiscal policy and explain why I believe that this is not the case.</p>

<p>In the following sections, I will first provide an overview of the US fiscal situation and what primarily drives budget deficits. Then I’ll quickly discuss whether public debt is sustainable, and then I’ll conclude with a normative discussion of whether US fiscal policy is truly “reckless”. To be clear, the discussion here is about the trajectory of public debt, that is, its historical and expected trend.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="us-fiscal-stance">US Fiscal Stance</h3>
<p><strong>Fiscal stance</strong> is a measure of whether government policy is stimulating the economy (expansionary), having no impact (neutral), or slowing the economy (contractionary). One common way to measure fiscal stance is the <strong>cyclically-adjusted primary balance</strong> (CAPB) as a fraction of potential output. Primary balance is the government’s budget balance adjusted for the business cycle. This removes the effects of the economic cycle on government budgets, so it is a better measure of policy decisions<sup>1</sup>.</p>

Figure&nbsp;2: <strong>Fiscal Stance</strong> is calculated as the negative of CAPB. A positive fiscal stance indicates expansionary fiscal policy, while a negative fiscal stance indicates contractionary fiscal policy. <strong>Fiscal impulse</strong> is the year-over-year change in fiscal stance. A positive fiscal impulse indicates that the government is becoming more expansionary, while a negative fiscal impulse indicates that the government is becoming in this case less expansionary.

<p>Figure&nbsp;2 shows that fiscal policy in the United States has been particularly expansionary at least since 2002 and according to IMF’s recent projections it is expected to remain so in the coming years, albeit at a slower pace. That means the US fiscal policy has been running deficits (unrelated to the cycle of the economy) for at least the last 20 years, and there is a good chance that this will continue.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-drives-us-deficits" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-drives-us-deficits">What Drives US deficits?</h3>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in the US groups spending into three broad categories: mandatory, discretionary, and interest spending. Mandatory outlays is seen as necessary for the economy to function, making it more difficult to change the law. In contrast, discretionary spending, such as defense spending, is more up to the government to decide what to do and hence is easier to change. The third category is self-explanatory: it is the interest paid by the government on its public debt.</p>
<p>So, what drives the US’s expansionary fiscal policy? According to the CBO data (Figure&nbsp;3), the majority of the US government’s spending is on mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare. As we can see, mandatory spending as a percentage of total outlays has been rising, particularly since the 1990s, and will most likely continue to consume the most of budgetary resources in the future. What we’re seeing here is the growing fiscal cost of population ageing as more people become eligible for mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare. This is a problem that most of the advanced world is dealing with, not just the United States.</p>

Figure&nbsp;3: US Government Spending (% Total)
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>On the other hand, as the US began to invest less in national defense after the end of Cold War, the share of discretionary spending in the budget has been declining over time and this trajectory is expected to continue. Finally, the share of interest payments has been hovering around 10% of the budget for all of these years, though it is expected to reach record levels as public indebtedness rises under unchanged policies. Overall, however, the cost of social programs would continue to dominate the budget.</p>
<p>Spending is only one factor contributing to the budget deficits. Obviously, the other factor that determines deficits is revenues. I will skip a detailed analysis here. Clearly, revenues were insufficient in comparison to total expenditures. What is worth commenting, however, is that tax revenues as a percentage of GDP were only <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/comparing-tax-systems-around-the-world/">25% in 2019,</a> much lower than the OECD average. Now, <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58888">according to the CBO</a>, revenues account for approximately 20% of GDP. This also implies a reluctance to raise taxes to finance the fiscal impact of an ageing population or to support the delivery of essential public services. In terms of the United States’ overall budgetary policy, I would say that deficits are more of a tax issue than a spending issue.</p>

<section id="fiscal-sustainability" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fiscal-sustainability">Fiscal Sustainability</h3>
<p>The growing US debt deficit raises concerns about the sustainability of public finances. To assess the situation, I will examine some key fundamentals.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Low overall Borrowing costs</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p>Markets place a lot of emphasis on borrowing costs. Not unjustifiably considering that politicians cannot directly control interest payments. However, if you start reading the news, you will think that US start being charged loan-sharking interest rates. Let’s see what the reality looks like. Below I show the effective interest rate against the 10-year U.S. Treasury (UST) bond. The effective interest rate is the overall cost of borrowing that takes into account all interest rates that the US government is charged for issuing different debt products. For convenience, I also have the monetary policy cycles since 1960s. Here what is worth commenting is that monetary policy play does not seem to play a particular role for the sustainability of debt. Other fundamentals, like level of debt, population and technological growth, productivity, and so on, are the factors mostly influencing trends in borrowing costs.</p>

Figure&nbsp;4: US Borrowing costs
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In the current situation, do you see anything to worry about here? I don’t. Overall borrowing costs are at the same levels as before the pandemic (Figure&nbsp;4). Debt service costs are still low, which is understandable given that long-term interest rates were structurally low before COVID-19. The monetary shock of the last 18 months is starting to have an impact on borrowing costs, but it is highly questionable whether this situation will last for too long as the diagram above also shows. It is also important to note that these are nominal borrowing costs. Subtracting inflation (which helps to deflate debt), the cost of borrowing is even lower <!--# There is the issue of inflation-linked bonds, but this is only a tiny fraction of the overall supply of bonds -->.</p>
<p>Secondly, consider the years preceding the 1980s. The era of rising borrowing costs. We can see that the effective interest rate was constantly below the 10y UST. This reflects the ability of governments to partially hedge its borrowing costs against rising interest rates by rolling-over debt and exploiting different maturity structures. After the long-standing structural problems of the last few decades, the maturity structure played less of a role because interest rates across different maturities start converging to the same levels, and thus the effective interest rate and the 10y UST were quite similar<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Favorable r-g fundamentals</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<p>Borrowing costs on their own do not necessarily matter. Measuring public indebtedness as a fraction of GDP, what effectively matters is the effective interest rate in relation to economic growth. In public finance literature, this is usually written as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r-g">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r"> is the previously mentioned effective interest rate and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g"> is the nominal growth rate of the economy. This <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r-g"> gap has a simple explanation. When the economy grows faster than debt, the debt-to-GDP ratio falls (and vice versa). In practice, and from purely a public finance perspective, extra debt may be added when the government is dis-saving (accumulates primary deficits) or removed when the government saves money (accumulates primary surpluses). Then, the debt creating flows (i.e.&nbsp;how public debt changes period-by-period) can be decomposed in two main parts: the contribution of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r-g"> dynamics and b) the behavior of primary balances. Anything else we can assume for simplicity are residual factors (such the so called stock-flow adjustments). This decomposition is also appealing because it provides a high-level overview of the part of public debt over which politicians have direct control, namely primary balances, and the part over which they do not, namely <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r-g"> dynamics. So, how does the picture come together when we put all of these pieces together? This is how this decomposition looks when using CBO data.</p>

Figure&nbsp;5: Debt Creating Flows
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Figure&nbsp;5 which deconstructs the year-over-year change in public debt into <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r-g">, primary balances, and residual factors, reveals that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) anticipates that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r-g"> dynamics will remain favorable at levels comparable to the previous decade. This suggests there is no compelling reason to believe that the national debt has gotten out of hand. Just balancing out the books the debt-to-GDP would be facing a <u><em>falling</em></u> trajectory. But even if we assume that public debt can reach quite high levels, such as 150%-180% of GDP, the baseline projections imply that the US government would need a small primary surplus, close to 1%-1.5% of GDP, to stabilize debt at that levels. Not trivial, but not difficult either, given how feasible such an adjustment is for such an extremely high public debt level<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Balance of Risks</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>However, debt sustainability is more than just a baseline. From the perspective of risk management, the distribution of r-g shocks, which encompass virtually every type of shock that could occur in the United States as well as internationally, is also crucial. How does this appear when examining the history of these shocks?</p>

Figure&nbsp;6: <strong>Distribution of r-g shocks</strong>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Figure&nbsp;6 shows the historical distribution of the r−g gap since the 1960s, as well as after the mid-1990s and what the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects. This analysis leads to two conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A negative r−g gap is usually the norm than the exception across all cases.</p></li>
<li><p>The balance of risks is asymmetric in favor of public finances, with the likelihood of favorable shocks (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%3Cg">) exceeding the chance of an unfavorable shock.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Simply put, during periods of economic uncertainty, governments, particularly the US government, can effectively leverage their perceived stability and creditworthiness to secure advantageous financing terms when issuing debt. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as a “flight to safety,” reflects the heightened demand for safe-haven assets during periods of stress. In such instances, investors seeking to preserve capital gravitate towards the perceived security of government bonds, driving down yields and facilitating debt issuance at attractive rates.</p>
<p>The US government, in particular, enjoys a unique position as a global financial anchor, benefiting from its deep and liquid bond market, strong fiscal institutions, and perceived resilience to economic shocks. This privileged status often translates into lower borrowing costs compared to other sovereigns, even during periods of heightened uncertainty.</p>
<p>While specific shocks, such as a US-induced financial crisis, could temporarily disrupt this dynamic, the overall trend suggests that governments, particularly the US government, can effectively utilize debt issuance as a counter-cyclical tool to manage their fiscal needs during periods of stress. In other words, the larger the negative risk event, the higher the bid for US bonds.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-fundamental-criterion-to-assess-the-us-fiscal-stance">A Fundamental Criterion to Assess the US Fiscal Stance</h3>
<p>The previous analysis implies it only implies that the United States has in principle an ability to sustain high debt. But the real question here is whether the US should actually do it. In public debates such strategy is frequently ruled out as reckless. However, in more general terms public debt is a very special instrument, and especially the US debt with the aforementioned properties needs not only balancing the public accounts but also the economy.</p>
<p>So, how can we tell if the fiscal situation is reasonable? So far, we have seen that the public debt is still under control. Should we consider where the US spends its money as the primary criterion? Many analysts continue to spread the myth that most US government spending is wasteful, but the vast majority of funds are spent on essential public services. So “reckless” isn’t the right word. Perhaps it’s a better word for the tax policy. The capacity of US deficits to absorb global savings and the (good) potential for crowding out excessive levels of savings and private capital, in my opinion, is the criterion that mostly applies in the current context (and for which where money is spent is less of an issue).</p>
<p>Generations of economists have been taught that crowding out private capital is always a bad thing. In the United States, it is definitely an ideologically appealing argument, helped by the fact that saying the opposite is counter-intuitive to the general public. “How can crowding out private investment ever be beneficial to the economy?” someone might ask. Actually, the answer is quite simple:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…<em>the presumption that increasing investment is always good for the economy relies on the fact that more investment leads to more output in the long run, and that more output helps achieve higher consumption. The first fact is mechanical, but the second is not necessarily true, because more capital also means more investment to maintain the same capital/output ratio. Consequently, there are limits as to how much capital should ideally be accumulated…</em>”<sup>4</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For decades, China has focused on export-led growth, but it is now realizing that domestic consumption is a more sustainable driver of economic growth. Japan’s long-term experience with the “savings trap” is another example of the consequences of excess capital.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, it is essential to differentiate between crowding out of capital over the business cycle and crowding out of capital over time. According to Keynesian theory, public debt cannot crowd out private investment in the short run, especially during recessions, because private investment is more sensitive to short-term economic growth prospects than to interest rates. However, public debt can crowd out private investment in the long run by increasing interest rates and decreasing the supply of loanable funds. Therefore, when I refer to crowding out of capital, I am referring to this long-term process, not the short-term one. The empirical evidence is crystal clear here and quite robust<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>To return to my original point, I believe that until we are really done with the structural problem of excess savings US debt might actually be too low. To clarify, this situation should not be confused with the excess savings from the pandemic or the zero-interest rate policy (ZIRP) era. Even though central bank interest rates are now relatively “high”, the economy may still be accumulating more capital than it needs, as it likely did before the global financial crisis. By excess savings I refer to the structural issue in which the supply of savings permanently exceeds the demand for savings. As we all know by experience, this can lead to a number of economic problems, including slow growth, low interest rates, financial crises, asset bubbles, excessive risk-taking, misallocation of resources. The US public debt is one way to permanently address these problems by creating the extra capacity to absorb more excess savings. The question then is how to assess whether we are still living in this world. The next section takes this issue more closely.</p>

<section id="when-an-economy-is-producing-more-savings-than-necessary" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-an-economy-is-producing-more-savings-than-necessary">When An Economy is Producing More Savings than Necessary</h3>
<p>The idea that an economy might over-accumulate capital, or save more than it needs to, is a possibility that many people can understand. However, it is more difficult to test this idea empirically and measure it in real time. Before I illustrate this, let us briefly review the concept of capital accumulation. Here I want to clarify that capital, savings, liquidity can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Do you recall Thomas Piketty’s international best-selling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century">book</a>? He referred to the situation in which the long-term interest rate (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*">) exceeds long-term economic growth (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g%5E*">) as the fundamental law of capitalism. This was the “normal” situation for most of the twentieth century. According to neoclassical economics, in this situation capitalism accumulates capital at the appropriate rate. However, neoclassical (or mainstream) economists have studied when this scenario might fail (for example, population ageing, incentives to accumulate wealth for retirement, so private pension schemes or replacing the welfare state with self-insurance mechanisms could be a bad idea in neoclassical economics). They predicted the consequences of the case where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*%3Cg%5E*">, and provided the “Marxist” recipe that in this case, capitalism might need a large expansion of government to save itself. This condition, when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*%3Cg%5E*">, is also the technical criterion that has been developed to assess whether an economy produces more savings than is required. In academic writing it is called “dynamic inefficiency”. “Dynamic” because it talks about how savings and capital build up over time (hence structural issue), and “inefficient” because the rate of building up capital (equivalently liquidity or savings) is too fast.</p>
<p>Because this is a new concept for most, let me try to explain it more simply. Dynamic inefficiency is an economic condition where the rate of capital accumulation exceeds the optimal level, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources and hindering long-term economic growth. This phenomenon is often observed in economies with a high savings rate, as excessive saving diverts resources away from current consumption and potential investment opportunities. This is why there is high chance ending in prolonged``liquidity or savings traps” as mentioned before.</p>
<p>The term “dynamic” emphasizes the time-dependent nature of this inefficiency. Capital accumulation, while beneficial for long-term growth, should occur at a pace that aligns with the economy’s productive capacity and demand for capital goods. When capital accumulation outpaces these factors, it signals a misallocation of how much we need to consume today vs the distant future, resulting in dynamic inefficiency.</p>
<p>The label “inefficient” highlights the sub-optimal allocation of resources caused by excessive savings. When savings exceed the optimal level, the economy as a whole prioritizes capital accumulation (savings) over current consumption and potential investment opportunities that could yield higher returns. This misallocation of resources hinders the economy’s ability to achieve a sustainable and balanced growth path.</p>
<p>In essence, dynamic inefficiency arises from a disconnect between the pace of capital accumulation and the economy’s ability to effectively utilize it. Excessive savings lead to an oversupply of capital, while the demand for capital goods lags behind. This imbalance creates a situation where resources are not optimally allocated, resulting in slower growth and diminished economic welfare.</p>
<p>The consequences of this equilibrium have long been discussed and understood in academia, including replicating ``Keynesian” ideas such as animal spirits and coordination failures, the build up of asset bubbles and increased financial fragility, the higher incentives of firms to buy their own stocks instead of investing and so on. In other words, fits well the stories describing the world before the pandemic. The <a href="http://www.econ.ucla.edu/fgeerolf/research/Efficiency_Emp.pdf">paper</a> of Geerolf has a nice review of what I discussed so far.</p>
<p>Note, the fact that the identity is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*%3Cg%5E*"> does not <em>necessarily</em> imply that long-term growth is “high”. However, because it differs from the usual case in which <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*%3Eg%5E*">, it has the interpretation that interest rates are low. Consider that there is a hypothetically ideal level of capital (academics call it the “Golden level or Rule”) against which actual capital can be compared. When actual capital exceeds this ideal, it is considered “too high” and accumulates at an unsustainable rate, causing interest rates (returns on capital) to fall to abnormally low levels, falling short of the economy’s long-term growth potentials.</p>
<p>Because I mentioned a few “stars,” it’s worth clarifying a few points. The confusion between what academics say and what policymakers, researchers, and market participants understand about what constitutes a low interest rate environment and the “stars” (that are usually discussed in public discussions and continue to grow in number) is so widespread that, as someone who has experienced all sides (academia, policy-making, markets), I begin to believe that each participant has invented its own school of thought about macroeconomics. The previous discussion of secular stagnation added more ambiguity to the situation. And I worry that many people will be very confused by these discussions.</p>
<p>To help clarify the situation. I am not referring to secular stagnation in what I have said. This isn’t necessary to the point I’m making about public debt, but it has the similar implications as the secular stagnation hypothesis. Secular stagnation is a hypothesis that says the economy is slowing down because there is not enough demand for investment. Technically, it poses the hypothesis that investments (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I">) are persistently lower than savings (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S">). Everything that stems from this hypothesis about interest rates and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*"> are just conjectures influenced by the theories about excess savings that I previously discussed. This mixture can be found in Blanchard’s <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/secular-stagnation-not-over">post</a>, though his (mistimed due to the pandemic events) <a href="https://fiscal-policy-under-low-interest-rates.pubpub.org/">book</a> more than clarifies the relevant concepts here.</p>
<p>Another difference that I want to highlight is that secular stagnation assumes that the imbalance is in the aggregate demand (which is I find it hard to believe, but easier to sell to governments), while the dynamic inefficiency criterion (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*%3Cg%5E*">) assumes that the imbalance is in the financial markets, which is more consistent with the “global savings glut”. So, secular stagnation you need more debt to clear aggregate demand, while the dynamic inefficiency you need more public debt to clear financial markets.</p>
<p>From the more practical point of view, another limitation of the secular stagnation hypothesis is that cannot be really tested. After all, for countries with current account surpluses the condition <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I%3CS"> always holds. Is this to say that China, whose <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> was always higher than <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I">, was in a long period of stagnation? Not at all. In contrast, the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E%E2%88%97%3Cg%5E%E2%88%97"> condition is a standard, well formalized, and understood criterion for excess savings with solid and mature theoretical foundations and with (academic) economists having long understood its consequences to a country’s long-term prospects and risks. Taking again China as an example, the empirical evidence suggests that China <a href="https://pep.vse.cz/pdfs/pep/2020/05/02.pdf">“today is unquestionably in a state of severe dynamic inefficiency, and the inefficient status is likely to continue in near future”</a>. Hence, confirming what most people believe that China has been savings too much.</p>
<p>The savings glut and, by extension, the dynamic inefficiency hypothesis better explain the post-1980s reality, including the nature of the shocks that triggered excess savings, such as China’s one-child policy. In his book ``End of Alchemy”, former UK central banker Mervyn King provides an excellent account of these events and their (well-known) consequences:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“… [<em>In China] The desire to save was very strong. In the absence of a social safety net, households in China chose to save large proportions of their income to provide self-insurance in the event of unemployment or ill-health, and to finance retirement consumption. Such a high level of saving was exacerbated by the policy from 1980 of limiting most families to one child, making it difficult for parents to rely on their children to provide for them in retirement</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“… Keen though western consumers were on spending, their appetite was not strong enough to offset the even greater wish of emerging economies to save…The consequence was that in the world economy as a whole there was an excess saving, or in the vivid phrase of Ben Bernanke .. a ‘savings glut’…. This glut of saving pushed down long-term interest rates around the world…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…<em>with interest rates so low financial institutions and investors started to take on more and more risk, in an increasingly desperate hunt for higher returns without adequate compensation [ i.e.&nbsp;the risk premium between safe assets like UK or US government bond&nbsp;and other financial assets was very low] such behavior become known as “search for yield” …… Banks played their part in meeting this search for yield. They created a superstructure of even more complex financial instruments…. Both the complexity and the size of financial assets increased markedly. Low interest rates were encouraging households to bring forward spending from the future to the present [i.e.&nbsp;borrow]. That, too, could not continue indefinitely – and it didn’t.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>.. Central banks provided emergency&nbsp;loans, but these amounted to little more than holding a sheet in front of the Emperor – in this case the baking system – conceal his nakedness. It didn’t solve the underlying problem: banks needed not loans but injections of shareholders capital to reduce their extraordinarily high levels of leverage and to absorb losses from risky investments they made….The system staggered on for a year. Market confidence in banks ebbed and flowed. But on 15 September the long-established&nbsp;investment bank Lehman Brother failed…“</em></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-question-of-public-debt">The Question of Public Debt</h3>
<p>Ironically, in the 1980s, economists like Larry Summers <a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/56/1/1/1673996">convinced</a> people that advanced economies could never be in a situation of excess savings. This not only consolidated the idea that crowding out private capital is always a bad idea but also contributed in designing fiscal frameworks where public debt was treated and seen more as an instrument for managing the economic cycle, along the lines of Keynesian economics. Hence, fiscal frameworks never build any capacity to foresee structural problems and view public debt as a tool treating excess savings. We also had all those reforms that the general public knows by the name “neo-liberal agenda”, which includes the advent of private pension systems, weakness of welfare state, and so on and helped accumulate extra buffer of savings. These issues were revisited after the Global Financial Crisis, but it was already too late.</p>
<p>The evidence from Summers et al.&nbsp;is too old to be useful now. So the question is whether we are still in this secular trajectory of excess savings, and hence if still makes sense to take this as the starting point in assessing US public debt. Some <a href="http://www.econ.ucla.edu/fgeerolf/research/Efficiency_Emp.pdf">new evidence</a> says so, confirming essentially Ben Bernanke’s hypothesis that the global economy has a savings glut problem. For reasons that I will explain later, when the global economy as a whole has a savings glut problem this mostly likely implies that the United States has it too. And, US public debt is key to fixing this problem.</p>
<p>To get a more “real-time” estimate of whether that starting point is still appropriate in the current circumstances, I’ll use the <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar">Holston, Laubach, Williams (HLW) dataset</a>, which produces estimates for both <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g%5E*">, and are the closest proxies for assessing dynamic inefficiency in real-time. People use their estimates to look at <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*">, possibly because they are more preoccupied with the day-to-day developments in the economy and what monetary policy is doing. But If we want to consider whether we are still in the same secular trend in which the there is a tendency in producing more liquidity that can be absorbed, then we should be looking at the level of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*"> in relation to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g%5E*">. That is why I also think that in this case “how accurate” the estimation of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*"> across different models is irrelevant; what matters is if the signal from these models are pointing to the same secular trajectory for the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*-g%5E*"> gap.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;7 shows how the real interest rate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*">, the long-term growth <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g%5E*">, and the gap between them (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*%E2%88%92g%5E%E2%88%97">) have evolved over time, along with the debt-to-GDP ratio, since the late 1960s. The data shows that both <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g%5E*"> have declined over time, and this is not a coincidence. While other factors, such as productivity growth, may also play a role, the accumulation of capital (savings) is certainly a major driver and common factor affecting the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*%E2%88%92g%5E%E2%88%97"> gap. The consequences of excessive savings start to become visible in the early 1980s. When savings begin to accumulate more quickly, we first notice a decrease in the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*%E2%88%92g%5E%E2%88%97"> gap. As savings become excessively high as a result of even higher global saving rates, the gap becomes negative. In other words, as excess liquidity became too prevalent around the world, it began to show up in US data as well. The turning point for the sign reversal in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*-g%5E*"> occurred around the mid-1990s, coinciding with the acceleration of globalization and the increased free movement of capital across the world. For example, the share of external debt as a percentage of total debt began to rise not only in the US, but also in countries like Greece.</p>

</div>
<p>The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%E2%88%92g"> gap in public finance and the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*%E2%88%92g%5E*"> gap here are typically linked. A favorable r−g gap helps sustain public debt and the US government’s ability to maintain higher debt levels. This ability can help address the issue of excess savings. In simpler terms, US debt is most likely to be sustainable when the world saves more than it spends. The strong correlation between the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%E2%88%92g"> gap and excess savings is evident when we combine the evidence presented here with the CBO data discussed earlier. Both show negative r−g gaps after 2000. However, excess savings is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the public finance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%E2%88%92g"> gap to be negative. Therefore, without further investigation, it is unclear whether the CBO’s long-term projection of a negative <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%E2%88%92g"> gap also indicates that excess savings are expected to persist. Nonetheless, the evidence here also shows that the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*%E2%88%92g%5E*"> gap is still negative even after the pandemic, suggesting that the secular problem of excess savings is still persisting. Therefore, starting from this situation strengthens the case for assessing public debt in light of its ability to absorb excess liquidity and crowd out excess savings.</p>
<p>The evolution of public debt in relation to the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*-g%5E*"> dynamics is also worth discussing. According to Figure&nbsp;7, the crowding-in (in this case) effects of falling public debt supported high levels of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*-g%5E*"> gap during the first period of falling public debt. During the early 1980s, when the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*-g%5E*"> gap began to close, some early warning signs began to emerge. It was a time of greater economic integration and a greater influx of liquidity into the United States. It is probable that the rising debt levels during this period partially offset the excess liquidity, this time as a result of crowding out effects. But as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*-g%5E*"> was close to zero, this level of public debt may have been close to optimal at the time (a situation referred to in academic writing as the Golden Rule). This observation, coincidentally or not, appears to be supported by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393298000312">some contemporary literature</a>.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, excess liquidity began to build up. The subsequent debt adjustment may have been too extensive contributing to excess savings even domestically in the US. After 2000, things changed rapidly. Public debt and the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*%E2%88%92g%5E*"> gap began moving in opposite directions, with debt rising and the gap declining, though it remained negative. The negative gap was further amplified by the Global Financial Crisis, despite the even faster rise in public debt. While correlations do not necessarily imply causation, and public debt could have crowd out capital, I believe that this clear disconnect between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*"> and public debt, as well as between public debt and the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*%E2%88%92g%5E*"> gap is due to two main reasons: (a) foreign lending and (b) excessive quantitative easing (QE).</p>
<p>First, during this period there was a massive influx from abroad to the US helping financing the US deficit. Overlapping global shocks, such as the global financial crisis, the Eurozone crisis, Brexit, and trade wars have led to excess fiscal adjustments in some countries (e.g., the UK and the Eurozone), higher uncertainty, and enormous surpluses in others (e.g., Asian countries). This has created a strong demand for US Treasury bonds, which has helped to finance the US deficit. The large inflow of foreign lending, which the Federal Reserve was not considering when making its quantitative easing decisions, significantly reduced any crowding out effects. This allowed the natural rate of interest <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*"> to remain low, and this in turn might have also dragged down long-term growth rate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g%5E*">.</p>
<p>Second, fiscal policy is often blamed for being too tight during this period, but I believe that the real issue was ultra-loose monetary policy. As I showed before, fiscal policy was overall expansionary. If monetary policy had not been so aggressive with enormous amounts of quantitative easing (QE), fiscal policy would have been able to crowd out more of the excessive savings in the US and abroad. Rising long-term real interest rates would have been all that was needed to lift all boats (inflation, recovery, growth, etc.). Crowding-out excess savings and private capital was essential for this and the Fed did not let it happen efficiently. Without a fiscal-monetary framework, monetary policy did not internalize the enormous global demand for US Treasuries and, by extension, the enormous amounts of foreign lending financing public debt. This distorted the proper functioning of public debt to absorb more of the excess savings and crowd out capital, so real interest rates could start rising again.</p>
<p>Would fiscal policy have been that expansionary without such ultra-loose monetary policy? In my view, yes. That is because most of this expansion was due to the mechanical increase in the cost of social programs. In other words, population aging and its fiscal impact on the budget were colliding to increase real interest rates, but the Fed severely distorted a better outcome.</p>
<p>Finally, closing the gap between the real interest rate (r*) and the economic growth rate (g*) does not necessarily mean that public debt will hurt growth. While there is evidence of the negative consequences of public debt on long-term growth, this evidence fails to distinguish between excess capital and non-excessive capital. Some <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0164070423000356">new theoretical work</a> also confirms this intuition. It is also masked by the fact that most of this evidence combines data from all countries and time periods, so the results are biased by periods of high population growth and no excess savings. Additionally, the evidence fails to show what happens to growth when public debt is used to finance social programs.</p>
<p>In addition, we should not forget history here. For instance, <a href="https://crei.cat/wp-content/uploads/users/working-papers/DIG.pdf">history has shown</a> that a potential contributing factor to the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain was the towering levels of public debt (which at the time was financing wasteful wars). This debt crowded out excess capital, enabling the nobility to abandon low-return investments like agricultural improvements and switch to emerging and more productive sectors like textiles and iron. In that sense, China’s dominance might actually accelerate if more of its excess savings instead of financing US deficits are used to finance domestic investments and public expenditures – as the plan currently is set up.</p>
<p>Therefore, until we are sure that long-term trends have substantially changed and the world, and by extension the US economy, is no longer living in an excess savings trajectory, the US public debt should be kept high.</p>

<p>I mentioned before that it doesn’t really matter whether the world or the US itself has a savings glut issue. Here’s why. Figure&nbsp;8 shows the global shares of budget and current account deficits for the US and other countries. The US current account deficit accounts for more than half of global current account deficits, and the US budget deficit is also large, accounting for close to 44% of the world’s total. To put it simply, the US is absorbing nearly two-thirds of global savings, with a significant proportion of this going to US budget deficit.</p>

<p>Although these numbers raise many other questions and expose some vulnerabilities, they also show that US fiscal policy is, in effect, the world’s fiscal policy. As long as the world as a whole continues to produce surpluses at a faster pace than the US produces deficits (a scenario that is not implausible given population aging, for example), US public debt is unlikely to have a significant impact on either domestic or global interest rates (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*">), or to crowd out a significant amount of capital (if at all in this case).</p>
<p>From this perspective, US public debt could still be too low, and the years ahead could resemble the (the equally unhealthy as the ZIRP) period before the Global Financial Crisis. The fiscal policies of other countries also matter, especially China’s, and to some extent the UK’s, Japan’s and Germany’s. But the lion’s share of responsibility for leading the world to a more robust growth prospects currently falls on US fiscal policy.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>The US public debt is rising, which is helping to absorb the world’s excess savings. Given long-term trends, increasing US public debt may be a good thing until there is evidence that this excess savings has been removed.</p>
<p>Public debt is not the only way to account for excess savings, but it is required if the global picture remains unchanged (i.e., same or worse welfare state, weak labour markets, hyper-globalization, further expansion of the private pension system, extreme wealth concentration, and so on). We can debate how best to spend this money and the mechanism to accomplish this, such as spending on public investments, causing some inflation to force the Fed to keep interest rates higher, financing climate change, or a combination of all of these, but being bold in mitigating the perpetual risk of excess savings within the financial system is not inherently harmful. High public debt in the United States can accomplish this by changing market incentives and discouraging excessive risk-taking behaviour. This, in turn, leads to a sustained period of strong global economic growth. However, achieving this would be contingent on three critical factors: foreign lending, domestic tax policies, and China’s fiscal framework. These factors are directly related to how much excess liquidity and private capital the US debt can accommodate, as well as the optimal debt level. Until we see a meaningful closing of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E*%20-%20g%5E*"> gap The public debt in the United States is far from optimal.</p>
<p>This is not to say that some short-run adjustment is not required, but the current signals indicate that significant debt adjustments that would necessitate running primary surpluses are not required.</p>
<p>Keeping US debt high until markets change their incentives would reduce the incentives to accumulate capital much faster than necessary and save too much. Of course, how quickly we reach that optimal point will be determined by other factors as well (e.g., slowing globalization, social reforms that reduce the incentives to save, etc.), but the US public debt is part of this equation and a countervailing force against saving too much.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the world of central banking, there are few policies that have been as widely discussed in recent years as forward guidance and balance sheet changes. These policy tools, known as non-conventional policies, define the broader monetary policy stance that goes beyond just setting the policy rate. For example, forward guidance is a method used by central banks to directly communicate or signal their intentions in order to shape expectations and influence interest rates in the desired direction. During the 2008 financial crisis, forward guidance and Quantitative Easing (QE) became especially critical tools, as the policy rate hit zero. In order to continue stimulating the economy, the Federal Reserve (Fed) needed to find new ways to do so. As Ben <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/21st-Century-Monetary-Policy-Inflation/dp/1324020466/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=1172080352962224&amp;hvadid=73255235197595&amp;hvbmt=be&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=4923&amp;hvnetw=o&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvtargid=kwd-73255197392577%3Aloc-188&amp;hydadcr=18495_2211395&amp;keywords=21st+century+monetary+policy&amp;qid=1681764141&amp;sr=8-1">Bernanke</a> put it, “<em>we had to be creative</em>.” Forward guidance allowed the Fed to do just that. More recently, forward guidance has played an important role in the ongoing debate over inflation. In this post, I will be looking at a few stylized facts about how the Fed uses this tool.</p>
</section>
<section id="measuring-unconventional-policies" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measuring-unconventional-policies">Measuring Unconventional Policies</h2>
<p>One way to measure the Fed’s unconventional policies is to look at the “proxy rate”, which is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (See <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/proxy-funds-rate/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2022/november/monetary-policy-stance-is-tighter-than-federal-funds-rate/">here</a>). The proxy rate combines the Fed’s policy rate with the level of interest rate implied by the balance sheet changes and direct communication. Hence it incorporates the hypothetical interest rate that associates with the unconventional components of monetary policy.</p>
<p>I have plotted the proxy and policy rate in Figure&nbsp;1 below. The proxy rate leads the actual policy rate because of the way monetary policy is implemented. Typically, the markets are set up in anticipation of a change in the policy rate before the change actually takes place. This pattern is (unsurprisingly) pronounced after 2007.</p>
<p>Before the global financial crisis, the proxy rate and the fund rate were closely correlated. However, they started to diverge after 2007, when quantitative easing (QE) and forward guidance became integral components of the monetary policy framework. During this period, the use of forward guidance amounted to a monetary policy stance of negative interest rates (validating the purpose that it was designed). These ultra-low interest rates persisted until 2014 according to the proxy rate. At that point the Fed started tightening its policy until the pandemic hit.</p>

Figure&nbsp;1: The Proxy and Policy Rate

</p>
<p>The Fed has been criticized (including by respected <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/CFM/assets/pdf/CFM-Discussion-Papers-2022/CFMDP2022-09-Paper.pdf">academics</a>) for acting too slowly to address inflation, but the truth is that they began to tighten financial conditions well before the interest rate hikes. In fact, they started eight months before the first hike in March 2022, and almost a year and a half after the pandemic shock (Figure&nbsp;1). This is important to note, because when the Fed changed course, inflation was mostly driven by <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/supply-and-demand-driven-pce-inflation/">supply-side factors</a>, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. This left less room for monetary policy to do much. However, the Fed clearly began to change course before the pressure from the demand side on inflation started to substantially pick up.</p>
<p>It’s worth emphasizing that even prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the proxy rate and the fund rate were not identical. Part of this discrepancy can be attributed to the inevitable measurement errors involved in calculating a statistical measure such as the proxy rate. Of course, it’s impossible to completely eliminate statistical errors, but we can reasonably assume that most of the difference between the proxy rate and the fund rate can be attributed to communication-related factors.</p>
<p>This evidence makes it clear that the inclusion of forward guidance and other unconventional tools has expanded the criteria by which the monetary policy stance should be evaluated. It is now clear that the Fed has become looser than it appears when stimulating the economy, and tighter than the policy rate indicates when tightening. As a result, it is becoming more important to get a better sense of the magnitude of the non-conventional aspects of monetary policy. The following paragraphs will examine this issue more closely.</p>

<p>The difference between the proxy and policy rate shows the level of interest rate implied by the Fed’s forward guidance. Figure&nbsp;2 shows exactly this. For example, at the peak of the proxy rate during this monetary policy tightening cycle, the Fed added an extra 3% to the policy rate by just pointing what will be doing. This means that until October 2022, the economy was effectively operating at an interest rate level closer to 6% than the official policy rate of 3%<sup>1</sup>. It was only after October 2022 that the proxy rate start coming off, signaling a less hawkish stance.</p>

<p>Fed’s tone shift was mostly evident in Jay Powell’s Jackson Hole speech last August who declared “<em>the Federal Reserve must keep at it until the job is done</em>”. The US stock market slid sharply after Powell spoke, with the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index falling 3.4 per cent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3.9 per cent, recording the one biggest one-day decline for both indices (outside sudden crashes).</p>
<p>To put things in perspective, in Figure&nbsp;3 I show the magnitude of this and other messages since 2020 and compare the unconventional part of the monetary policy to historical standards. The calculations are still based on the distance between the proxy rate and the policy rate. The left panel shows the average impact of communication-related factors across all tightening episodes since mid-70s as identified by the proxy rate. For the relevant periods, I have also filtered out the direct impact of balance sheet changes<sup>2</sup>. The right panel shows the distribution of the interest rates implied by forward guidance across each decades<sup>3</sup>.</p>

</p>
<p>Ben Bernanke once said that “monetary policy is 99% words and 1% action.” This was certainly true in the current tightening cycle, where the Fed’s words had an unprecedented impact. The Fed’s communication and signaling factors added (on average) an additional 1.5 percent of interest rates hikes, which is three times more than the most aggressive Fed of the past.</p>
<p>The credibility factor also played a role here. Before gaining the “credibility medal” the Fed struggled to convince the markets in the first two tightening cycles in Figure 3, even though it raised rates significantly. Things changed with Paul Volcker, but it wasn’t until forward guidance became part of the monetary policy transmission mechanism that markets started taking the Fed seriously.</p>
<p>Another way to look at the impact of the Fed’s messaging in recent years is to look at the right panel of Figure&nbsp;3, where I have plotted the distribution of the impact of forward guidance (in terms of interest rates). The Fed is now more likely to be seen as hawkish than dovish, given its seriousness in fighting inflation and the fact that markets still have faith in its words. This was not the case in the 1970s and 1980s. It is also worth noting that the formal incorporation of forward guidance has managed to have a relatively even impact across different economic conditions, indicating some ability to weigh the balance of risks and fine-tune its words to the situation.</p>

<section id="the-implications-for-soft-landing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-implications-for-soft-landing">The implications for Soft Landing</h2>
<p>In the meantime, the Fed has carried out the swiftest policy rate increase in the history of the United States. As I have briefly discussed in a previous <a href="https://msh855.github.io/TheQuantEconomist/posts/fed_and_private_consumption/the_fed_and_private_consumption.html">post</a>, the present interest rate level suggests that the impact on output is likely to be just as significant. This implies that the response from the Fed’s end has been sufficiently forceful in all areas under its <em>direct</em> control. It’s hard not to draw the conclusion that we are presently experiencing the most hawkish monetary policy position in recent US history, and its repercussions are just beginning to materialize<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>Does this mean that a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/softlanding.asp">soft landing</a> is off the table? That’s a whole other discussion. But the short answer is “No”. In fact, the opposite is true. According to this evidence, the Fed’s actions are what kept a soft landing on the cards. And, this shouldn’t be surprising. Technically, only the Fed needs to comply to a soft landing because of its mandate to balance maximum employment and price stability. Other central banks don’t have this restriction<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, soft landing is still the holy grail of central banking. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudi_Dornbusch">R. Dornbusch</a> famously said, “<em>No postwar recovery has died in bed of old age—the Federal Reserve has murdered every one of them</em>”. The most notable (and technically the only) soft landing in the most recent 16 business cycles occurred in 1994 under Alan Greenspan. Inflation was rising rapidly in 1994, and Greenspan raised interest rates seven times in the space of a year, bringing them up to 6%. This was a significant increase, but it did not cause a recession. In fact, the economy continued to grow throughout 1994 and 1995. Why was it successful? Economists will pick three main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the economy was strong at the time, which helped to cushion the impact of the higher interest rates.</li>
<li>Second, Greenspan was able to communicate his intentions clearly to the public, which helped to reduce uncertainty.</li>
<li>Third, Greenspan was able to raise interest rates gradually, giving businesses and consumers time to adjust.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Figure&nbsp;4, I plotted this episode and compared it to the current tightening cycle. I also added the “Hard landing” of Volcker (which was essentially started by Burns and Miller) and the in-between tightening cycle of 1999 to make the case clearer. Before the 1980s, any comparisons are meaningless, as the Gold Standard was in place, there was a substantially different monetary policy framework, and fiscal dominance was the norm. I also ignored the tightening cycle that preceded the Global Financial Crisis (for obvious reasons) and the tightening cycle of 2018, as it was disrupted by the pandemic.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>The Fed’s reaction function under Greenspan and now is quite similar, including making up for Friedman’s “long and variable lags.” However, unlike in the past, the use of unconventional tools allows the Fed to adjust its policy more smoothly and early on, without raising the policy rate. The three conditions that made Greenspan a legend continue to hold in some reasonable sense. The dynamics are also similar to the tightening cycle of 1999, which ended with the dot-com crash. However, as the “mini” banking crisis clearly demonstrated, the financial system is much more resilient today. Of course, there are some factors that are different between now and then, such as the starting level of inflation.</p>
<p>To conclude, a soft landing is primarily a fine-tuning exercise that is difficult to achieve, almost identical if not as elusive as timing the market. Based on the evidence here, the Fed has taken all necessary steps to achieve this goal and some of the necessary conditions for a soft landing are clearly met. But I do think that, overall, luck factors are more important than they were in the past<sup>6</sup>.</p>

That is the reason why Bernanke wanted more QE to offset these effects and compensate for the tight fiscal policy at the time.

Supply shocks are also “luck factors” from the policy-making point of view as central banks have no control on how to tackle them. The can of course try to respond by offsetting their impact, but this is not a good policy. It is far better to have governments address the source of the problem. In addition, a soft landing substantially depends on the pace at which central banks want to bring inflation down. A fast pace implies less chance of a soft landing, as it would require the real economy to be crashed. Too slow also reduces the chance of a soft landing, as there is a high chance that inflation expectations will become de-anchored or new unfavorable shocks might hit the system.↩︎</p></li>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Central banks have begun their tightening cycle to bring an exceptionally high inflation rate down, and are committed to even more tightening if inflation remains high. In assessing the tightness of monetary policy, it is common to compare the policy rate (the rate at which banks lend to each other) to the size of inflation or the level of neutral interest rates, and to compare this distance across time. However, this approach does not tell us much about the expected drop in aggregate demand.</p>
<p>More importantly, comparisons across time are not very meaningful. For example, a 50 basis point increase in the policy rate might have a stronger impact today than it did 20-30 years ago, because a much larger number of people are now leveraged. Therefore, even if the distance between the policy rate and inflation looks larger (or smaller) between two different periods, such comparisons are inconsistent due to differences in the prevailing structure of the economy.</p>
<p>he Federal Reserve’s ability to control inflation is closely linked to how interest rates affect consumer spending. This is because consumer spending accounts for roughly 60% of aggregate demand, which is equivalent to GDP. Therefore, a supplementary (and perhaps more appropriate) way to assess the tightness of monetary policy is to look at the effects of interest rates on private consumption.</p>
<p>The short-term nominal interest rates, which are the Federal Reserve’s main tool for affecting aggregate demand, transmit to private consumption in two broad ways. The first is through a direct channel, which takes into account how interest rates alone affect consumption. The second is through an indirect channel, which only focuses on the second-order effects of interest rate changes on aggregate demand, namely the change in disposable income of households. It is important to note that the indirect effects emanate from the direct impact of the original interest rate change and are therefore a function of consumers’ response to rising interest rates.</p>
<p>In evaluating the right monetary policy stance, it is necessary to make judgments on two interdependent issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the direct effects would affect consumption.</li>
<li>Whether the transmission mechanism of monetary policy relies more on the direct or indirect channel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inappropriate judgments on the first issue would necessarily lead to misleading or fallacious judgments on the second. While the first issue may seem less controversial, the quantitative impact of monetary policy on private consumption is still ambiguous.</p>
<p>In this post, I will focus on the first issue. Clarifying this issue can help to bring more clarity when assessing monetary policy tightness. For example, if the direct effects are expected to be sufficiently strong, the fall in disposable income will contribute less to the drop in aggregate demand. Otherwise, the potential reliance on the indirect effects implies a more persistent inflation and uncertain outlook, and adds to the factors that the Federal Reserve needs to overcome, since such second-order effects are (together with the supply side factors) not under its direct control.</p>

<section id="interest-rates-and-the-price-of-consumption-across-time" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interest-rates-and-the-price-of-consumption-across-time">Interest rates and the price of consumption across time</h2>
<p>The effects of interest rates on consumption are a central part of macroeconomic theory. When interest rates rise, there are two main effects:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The substitution effect</strong>: Higher interest rates make it more expensive to consume now, so people tend to save more and consume less.</li>
<li><strong>The income effect</strong>: Higher interest rates also increase the income that people earn from their savings, which can lead to increased consumption.</li>
</ol>
<p>The overall effect of interest rates on consumption is ambiguous, and depends on the relative strength of the substitution and income effects. In general, the substitution effect is stronger for people who have lower incomes and less wealth, while the income effect is stronger for people who have higher incomes and more wealth.</p>
<p>The conventional view is that (on aggregate) higher interest rates reduce consumption, as the substitution effect outweighs the income effect. However, the size of the effect is uncertain, and depends on the distribution of income and wealth in the economy.</p>
<p>One way to measure the relative strength of the substitution and income effects is to look at the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS). The EIS is a measure of how responsive people are to changes in interest rates. A higher EIS means that people are more likely to save when interest rates rise, and consume less.</p>
<p>In the next section, I estimate the EIS based on the Fed’s forecasts. This will allow me to extract the implicit judgement that the Fed is making about the effects of interest rates on consumption.</p>

<section id="some-illustrative-and-inconvenient-arithmetics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="some-illustrative-and-inconvenient-arithmetics">Some illustrative (and inconvenient) Arithmetics</h2>
<p>To this end, I will use a conventional macroeconomic approach. This may not allow definite conclusions, but it works well as a proof of concept. Assuming that households are reasonably forward-looking, conventional macroeconomic theory likes to use the so-called Euler equation to study consumption dynamics. People may also be familiar with this equation through the CAMP model, which is used to study the relationship between business cycles and asset prices.</p>
<p>There are various versions of this equation, depending on the application. For the point I want to make here, a conventional approach is sufficient. In this case, and in order to link inflation, interest rates, consumption, income, and substitution effects, I would assume that aggregate consumption follows the rule below (See <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6377146.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.thijsvanrens.com/macro/SE_IE_note.pdf">here</a> for a simple example)</p>

<p>The parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> is the so-called <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Elasticity_of_intertemporal_substitution">elasticity of intertemporal substitution</a>, which controls the sensitivity of consumption growth to changes in interest rates<sup>1</sup>. The higher this value, the more sensitive consumption growth is to a change in interest rates. This parameter also controls the balance between the substitution and income effects. More specifically:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csigma%0A%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D%0A%3C%201%20%5Cqquad%20%5Ctext%7BIncome%20Effect%20%3E%20Substitution%20Effect%7D%20%5C%5C%0A%3E%201%20%5Cqquad%20%5Ctext%7BIncome%20Effect%20%3C%20Substitution%20Effect%7D%20%5C%5C%0A=%201%20%5Cqquad%20%5Ctext%7BIncome%20Effect%20=%20Substitution%20Effect%7D%0A%5Cend%7Bcases%7D%0A"></p>
<p>An estimate of less than one implies that the income effect dominates the substitution effect and consumption tends to increase after an increase in interest rates. Conversely, when the substitution effect is greater than the income effect (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%20%3E%201">), higher interest rates encourage more savings and less borrowing, hence aggregate demand falls. There is also the third case where these two effects cancel each other out, so consumption is insensitive to interest rates. This is irrelevant in the short run, but not implausible in the long run.</p>
<p>Note that the natural interest rate is a function of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">, which captures households’ desire to smooth consumption over time. For example, if consumers <em>permanently</em> change their consumption preferences (e.g.&nbsp;becoming more stingy) this affects the path of consumption and, by extension, the supply of savings, which is important for natural interest rates.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20220615.htm">June statement</a>, the Fed released the following projections:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<th>2022</th>
<th>2023</th>
<th>2024</th>
<th>Long-run</th>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Federal funds rate</td>
<td>3.4</td>
<td>3.4</td>
<td>3.4</td>
<td>2.5</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I use these projections to reverse engineer and uncover the parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> based on the consumption rule above. As the Federal Reserve does not publish its projections for real consumption growth, I will use real GDP growth instead. In the data, real GDP growth and real consumption growth are strongly correlated (the correlation coefficient is roughly 0.90–0.99), so this approximation does little harm. Therefore, such forecasts imply that the EIS is:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>2022</th>
<th>2023</th>
<th>2024</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Central Scenario</td>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>4.5</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For the year 2022, it was not possible to estimate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">, since mathematically, the interest rates were too low for the size of inflation, and therefore the logarithm was not defined. In general, the Fed’s central forecasts imply a rather stable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%20%5Capprox%205"> across the forecast years. Interestingly, this in turn implies that the Fed may need to raise interest rates by another 200 basis points by the end of 2022 in order to validate its assumption.</p>
<p>This evidence suggests that a) the Fed may be assuming that substitution effects outweigh income effects on the aggregate<sup>2</sup>, which is in line with conventional wisdom, but is also signalling that markets might be underestimating the probability for higher interest rates in the future.</p>

<p>However, in the current context, the strength of the substitution effects, that is, the size of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS), also matters for the tightness of monetary policy. To get a sense of this, I used an excellent <a href="http://meta-analysis.cz/substitution/">meta-analysis</a> that collects more than 2,700 published estimates of the EIS across countries, with about half of them focusing on the United States. Based on this study, I show below the distribution of the EIS across countries, including the US. The red horizontal line is when the EIS equals 1, so values above this line indicate when the substitution effect dominates.</p>

<p>The good news is that the Fed’s forecasts suggest that monetary policy is quite tight (more than the market assumes). This is because the estimated value of the elasticity of substitution, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">, lies in the range of extreme values. For the size of the substitution effects assumed here, the rise in interest rates implies a rather strong impact on consumption in the near term.</p>
<p>The bad news is that the Fed is quite likely to be wrong. The most likely values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma"> (see Figure) suggest that the income effect typically dominates. This means that consumption could still drop, but not as much as the Fed might be expecting. This is because the rich are likely to hold consumption firm, even if interest rates rise. Relative to the case where the substitution effects dominate, consumption takes a smaller hit in this case, but it takes a longer time to recover.</p>
<p>The ugly part is that central banks, including the Fed, have traditionally focused on aggregate outcomes. This was partly due to data limitations, as it was hard to identify distributional effects without large individual-level panels. But it also reflected the conventional view that monetary policy works largely through intertemporal substitution, which was thought to affect everyone in much the same way. Nevertheless, recent recent <a href="https://benjaminmoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/HANK.pdf">research</a> is convincingly suggesting that monetary policy works largely through indirect effects. As I noted, income effects are likely to be empirically more relevant than the Fed might be assuming. Practically, this means that the lags of monetary policy might be too long to affect private consumption much.</p>

<p>My previous post did not aim to provide a comprehensive analysis. To simplify matters, I only focused on consumption-saving choices, taking into account the desire of consumers to smooth consumption over time. However, at times of heightened uncertainty, households may develop another motive for saving: precautionary savings. This is a way of insuring themselves against uncertain labor market prospects. A precautionary savings motive combined with pessimistic sentiment also contributes to a falling aggregate demand. Therefore, even if the Fed gets it wrong with the intertemporal substitution, uncertainty is on its side. All it takes is to spread the fear of recession and aggregate demand (and oil prices) will fall.</p>
<p>Wealth effects, that is the drop in consumption due to the fall in asset prices, is another important channel that affects private consumption. I did not discuss this here either, but I expect that such effects are already incorporated in the Fed’s latest forecasts. In principle, one could use the same strategy that I developed here to uncover what the Fed is expecting, but the consumption rule might need to be changed to Epstein-Zin preferences.</p>
<p>Overall, however, it appears that luck factors are more important for inflation dynamics. Neither the supply side factors nor the indirect effects are under the Fed’s direct control.</p>

  <title>How different are the 70s from today?</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<div align="justify">

<p>The war in Ukraine has raised significantly the odds of a recession in the near term, but also the likelihood to move into a new inflation regime as in the 70s. How real this risk is, depends on the key differentiating factors between now and then.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, textbooks would tell that a sequence of oil crises (rooted, like now, in geopolitical factors) permanently increased the cost of production for firms and, by extension, the cost of goods and services. This subsequently triggered a wage-price spiral (as households were trying to catch up with rising prices) which led to ever-increasing inflation. Such past experience places a material probability that a similar mechanism triggered by the same factors (oil shock and high inflation) might re-emerge with the Fed or all other major central banks unable to control inflation.</p>
<p>A closer look, however, at the underlying factors that underpinned the mechanism behind this wage-price spiral would suggest that this time is different. In short, the structurally weaker bargaining power of workers and its dependency on the economic cycle is effectively putting an upper limit to any catch-up of wages with extreme inflation. The direct implication of this key differentiating factor alone is that a) any wage-price spiral is likely to be short-lived relative to the 70s, especially when growth would start to slow down and b) the cost-push shocks are unlikely to turn into permanent supply shocks as then.</p>
<p>In the rest of this post, I will mostly focus on discussing this argument in more detail, along with a few other, more known, key dissimilarities between then and now. In my mind, I have mostly the US economy, but some of the arguments are relevant to other countries, too.</p>
<section id="the-70s-and-now" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-70s-and-now">The 70s and now</h2>
<p>One obvious difference between now and then, is that this wage-price spiral that unfolded during the 70s was heavily relying on the structurally strong bargaining power of workers that is absent today. Workers at the time were unionised and their bargaining power did not necessarily depend on the tightness of the labour market or the state of the economy as now. Currently, a recession or a slowdown in economic activity (either due to monetary policy tightening or a negative shock such as now with oil prices) is almost automatically reducing the bargaining power of most workers, and this in a fashion that nominal wages might not necessarily catch-up with inflation without legislation.</p>
<p>An exception here might be the high-income high-skilled households who nevertheless tend to consume less energy-intensive products (with declining overtime cost of production due to technological advancements) while their high marginal propensity to save diminishes the strength of aggregate demand on prices (formally flattening of the Philips Curve). This also highlights that in the absence of trade unions the degree of (wage or income) inequalities is another confounding factor that stops wages from catching up with inflation and implies that, on the aggregate, real wages most likely would fall. This effect in turn can help offset the (often reversible) production costs due to higher energy prices and help prevent the cost-push shocks to turn permanent.</p>
<p>Put more simply, the structurally weaker bargaining position of workers in effect implies that any temporary cost-push shocks are less likely to manifest themselves into the permanent supply shock of the 70s, especially since oil is now a less important input to production compared to the past.</p>
<p>New modes of work arrangements and the ability of multinationals to either outsource or reallocate abroad (expensive) labour-intensive functions are two other factors that can reduce the persistence of cost-push shocks. For example, competition might force firms to contain their labour costs and among the available options they have is to offer indefinite work-from-home arrangements. This new mode of working could lift some of the pressure for workers to catch up with inflation when they are given the option to indefinitely move to less expensive regions. On the other hand, multinationals might choose to react more aggressively if they think their profitability is severely distressed. For example, they could choose to outsource some of their labour-intensive high-skill functions or reallocate their workers abroad. Given their size in the economy and the limited availability of quality jobs for high-skilled workers in advanced economies, this might further reduce the bargaining power of workers when economic growth slows down.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="excess-saving-secular-stagnation-low-interest-rate-and-all-that">Excess saving, secular stagnation, low-interest rate and all that</h2>
<p>Secondly, the world now is structurally very different from the 70s. We live in a world where the global economy (perhaps for the first time in its history) is producing an excess amount of savings with record-low real investments. With governments around the world not really solving this problem, it is extremely unlikely to see any change in this structural issue in the foreseeable future. This dearth of investments contains, therefore, a very strong deflationary process that was totally absent during the 70s.</p>
<p>The forced coordination across countries to transition to net-zero, or the accidental coordination to increase defence spending (which has little to no influence on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r%5E%7B*%7D">, the natural interest rate), is unlikely to outweigh the strong incentives to save that come from demographics, higher inequalities, structural weaknesses in labour markets combined with a weaker welfare state, and government or private market schemes, such as private pension schemes or other unfunded social security programs. These schemes typically raise the incentives to save, but at the cost of depressed returns on capital and higher financial risk. This further reinforces the incentive to save to reach target wealth levels by retirement, which in turn further depresses returns, and so on (a “savings trap”). We now know from experience that in this world, financial markets have a stronger incentive to keep most of the liquidity in the financial system (in search of yield) rather than finance real investments that depend on a very weak long-term growth outlook.</p>
</section>
<section id="other-key-differences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-key-differences">Other key differences</h2>
<p>There are a few other more nuanced differentiating factors that are worth highlighting here. First, the degree of financialization together with the prevalence of idiosyncratic financial risks to households unveils other strong deflationary forces.</p>
<p>For households, is safe to assume that it is more challenging now to insure against the risk of employment, career and job displacement risks, health shocks etc. So, the most important insurance mechanism against bad outcomes is to build up buffers of savings and more wealth. Such a (structural) precautionary savings motive might be stronger today than in the past for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Much weaker welfare states and employment protection that increase the severity of possible negative income shocks (which academic economists showed also explain the skewness of, much more uneven today, wealth distribution )</li>
<li>More leveraged households are extremely susceptible to negative wealth shocks mainly due to the housing market</li>
<li>More individualistic societies that make people rely more on their own feet than expect the help of others. Having money and building up wealth becomes then a high-order priority for most households to survive any adverse outcome or to increase their quality of life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, the degree of financialization, as is captured by what economists might call market incompleteness, has increased since the 70s due to the liberalisation of capital flows and the availability of more hedging instruments. Now, the degree by which investors can hedge against risks is substantially greater today than before. In a world in which liquidity is abundant, this reinforces the incentives of the financial system to allocate more money into (risky) financial assets rather finance real investments (which as said before rely on a weak long-term growth outlook).</p>
</section>
<section id="final-thoughts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Although this analysis is anything but comprehensive and the future is always uncertain, I highlighted here a few crucial differentiating factors that play a dominant role in most economies today and are important for the inflation regime. The deflationary forces from the structurally weaker labour force not only put an upper limit to the wage-price spiral (that is central to many peoples’ arguments for inflation to go out of hand) but also limit the extent by which a cost-push shock can turn into a permanent supply shock. This, together with the legacies from the “excess savings world”, unleashes a strong deflationary process that can only be reversed by either a serious escalation in the war in Ukraine (a largely unpredictable factor) or by some serious policy mistake from now on.</p>
<p>All these suggest that the Fed can still control inflation, albeit at the cost of a recession or slow economic growth in the near term. In addition, the structural characteristics in the labour markets also imply that the deflationary process might be asymmetric and less synchronised across countries (i.e.&nbsp;the opposite case with the existing inflation dynamics).</p>
<p>For Eurozone countries, which also inherit other critical similarities with the 70s such as the “fixed exchange rate” regime, rising public debt, and current account imbalances, as well as, feature higher sensitivity to oil prices, inflation might become a source of a new political conflict due to ECB’s hawkish turn. This adds a greater uncertainty in Eurozone countries around the long-term inflation outlook and does not rule out the possibility that some countries might indeed experience relatively long stagflation given the ECB’s asymmetric (recessionary) implications and their different structural characteristics, and the imperfect political and fiscal union.</p>
