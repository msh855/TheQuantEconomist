These policy tools (known as non-conventional policies), define the broader monetary policy stance that goes beyond than just setting the policy rate. For example, forward guidance[^1] is a method used by central banks to directly communicate or signal their intentions in order to shape expectations and influence interest rates in the desired direction. During the 2008 financial crisis, forward guidance and Quantitative Easing (QE) became especially critical tools, as the policy rate hit zero. In order to continue stimulating the economy, the Federal Reserve (Fed) needed to find new ways to do so. As Ben [Bernanke](https://www.amazon.co.uk/21st-Century-Monetary-Policy-Inflation/dp/1324020466/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=1172080352962224&hvadid=73255235197595&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=4923&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=e&hvtargid=kwd-73255197392577%3Aloc-188&hydadcr=18495_2211395&keywords=21st+century+monetary+policy&qid=1681764141&sr=8-1) put it, \"*we had to be creative*.\" Forward guidance allowed the Fed to do just that. More recently, forward guidance has played an important role in the ongoing debate over inflation. In this post, I will be looking at a few stylized facts about how the Fed uses this tool.\n\n[^1]: Throughout this post, I would be using this term to refer to the effects of direct communication or the signaling channel of balance sheet changes.\n\n\n## Measuring Unconventional Policies \n\nOne way to measure the Fed's unconventional policies is to look at the \"proxy rate\", which is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (See [here](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/proxy-funds-rate/) and [here](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2022/november/monetary-policy-stance-is-tighter-than-federal-funds-rate/)). The proxy rate combines the Fed's policy rate with the level of interest rate implied by the balance sheet changes and direct communication. Hence it incorporates the hypothetical interest rate that captures the total impact of balance sheet changes (which are also used to guide expectations) and statements on financial markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have plotted the proxy and policy rate in @fig-1 below. Note that the proxy rate leads the actual policy rate because of the way monetary policy is implemented. Typically, the markets are set up in anticipation of a change in the policy rate before the change actually takes place. This pattern is (unsurprisingly) pronounced after 2007.\n\nBefore the global financial crisis, the proxy rate and the fund rate were closely correlated. However, they started to diverge after 2007, when quantitative easing (QE) and forward guidance became integral components of the monetary policy framework. During this period, the use of forward guidance amounted to a monetary policy stance of negative interest rates (validating the purpose that it was designed). These ultra-low interest rates persisted until 2014 according to the proxy rate. At that point the Fed started tightening its policy until the pandemic hit.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![The Proxy and Policy Rate](Hawkish_Fed_files/figure-html/fig-1-output-1.png){#fig-1 width=820 height=350}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nIn recent years, many people (including respected [academics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/CFM/assets/pdf/CFM-Discussion-Papers-2022/CFMDP2022-09-Paper.pdf)) have criticized the Fed for acting too slowly to address the rising inflation. However, according to this evidence, the Fed began to tighten financial conditions well before the interest rate hikes took place. In fact, the actual tightening began eight months before the first rate hike in March 2022, and almost a year and a half after the pandemic shock. Note that when the Fed changed course, inflation was mostly [driven by supply-side factors](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/supply-and-demand-driven-pce-inflation/), such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. As a result, there was less room for monetary policy to do much. However, the Fed clearly began to change course before the pressure from the demand side on inflation started to substantially pick up.\n\nIt's worth emphasizing that even prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the proxy rate and the fund rate were not identical. Part of this discrepancy can be attributed to the inevitable measurement errors involved in calculating a statistical measure such as the proxy rate. Of course, it's impossible to completely eliminate statistical errors, but we can reasonably assume that most of the difference between the proxy rate and the fund rate can be attributed to communication-related factors.\n\nThis evidence makes it clear that the inclusion of forward guidance and other unconventional tools has expanded the criteria by which the monetary policy stance should be evaluated. It is now clear that the Fed has become looser than it appears when stimulating the economy, and tighter than the policy rate indicates when tightening. As a result, it is becoming more important to get a better sense of the magnitude of the non-conventional aspects of monetary policy. The following paragraphs will examine this issue more closely.\n\n\n## \"Until the Job is Done\" \n\nThe difference between the proxy and policy rate shows the level of interest rate implied by the Fed's forward guidance. @fig-2 shows exactly this. For example, at the peak of the proxy rate during this monetary policy tightening cycle, the Fed added an extra 3% to the policy rate by just pointing what will be doing. This means that until October 2022, the economy was effectively operating at an interest rate level closer to 6% than the official policy rate of 3%[^2]. It was only after October 2022 that the proxy rate start coming off, signaling a less hawkish stance.\n\n[^2]: It is sometimes surprising to hear Fed officials (such as James B. Bullard) support their arguments for the appropriate policy rate by referring to the Taylor rule, without considering the effects of direct communication, including the signals that their analysis sends to the markets. But it is even more surprising that analysts, journalists, and strategists often perpetuate the flaws in their thinking.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Interest Rates equivalent of Direct Communication](Hawkish_Fed_files/figure-html/fig-2-output-1.png){#fig-2 width=639 height=478}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\nFed's tone shift was mostly evident in Jay Powell's Jackson Hole speech last August who declared ``the Federal Reserve must keep at it until the job is done‚Äù. The US stock market slid sharply after Powell spoke, with the benchmark S&P 500 index falling 3.4 per cent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3.9 per cent, recording the one biggest one-day decline for both indices (outside sudden crashes). \n\nTo put things in perspective, in @fig-2 I show the magnitude of this and other messages since 2020 and compare the unconventional part of the monetary policy to historical standards. The calculations are still based on the distance between the proxy rate and the policy rate. The left panel shows the average interest rate across each decade that are implied by the non-conventional factors, where I have also filtered out the direct impact of balance sheet changes. The right panel shows the distribution of the interest rates across each decades^[For readers not familiar with the box plots, see this [post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot)]. To get some sense of the communication-related factors and other signalling channels, I also isolated the direct influence of the balance sheet changes.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Hawkish_Fed_files/figure-html/cell-7-output-1.png){width=818 height=361}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n%This was not the only hawkish message,  of this and the previous and subsequent messages was unparalleled and matched the record level of inflation since the 70s. In fact, the evidence in @fig-2 suggests that the effects of its direct communication and balance sheet changes had the largest impact in the US history. \n\n\n## The implications for Soft Landing\n\nIn the meantime, the Fed has carried out the swiftest policy rate increase in the history of the United States. As I have briefly discussed in a previous [post](https://msh855.github.io/TheQuantEconomist/posts/fed_and_private_consumption/the_fed_and_private_consumption.html), the present interest rate level suggests that the impact on output is likely to be just as significant. This implies that the response from the Fed's end has been sufficiently forceful in all areas under its *direct* control. It's hard not to draw the conclusion that we are presently experiencing the most hawkish monetary policy position in recent US history, and its repercussions are just beginning to materialize^[We can discuss about the level of interest rates, but as I have explained in an earlier [post](https://msh855.github.io/TheQuantEconomist/posts/fed_and_private_consumption/the_fed_and_private_consumption.html) I am very critical of the standard practice in using the distance of the policy rate relative to the neutral rates to indicate how neutral monetary policy is.]. \n\nDoes this mean that a [soft landing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/softlanding.asp) is off the table? That's a whole other discussion. But the short answer is \"No.\" In fact, the opposite is true. According to this evidence, the Fed's actions are what kept a soft landing on the table. And, this shouldn't be surprising. Technically, only the Fed needs to comply to a soft landing because of its mandate to balance maximum employment and price stability. Other central banks don't have this restriction[^3]. \n\nNevetheless, soft landing is still the holy grail of central banking. [R. Dornbusch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudi_Dornbusch) famously said, \"*No postwar recovery has died in bed of old age---the Federal Reserve has murdered every one of them*\". The most notable (and technically the only) soft landing in the most recent 16 business cycles occurred in 1994 under Alan Greenspan. Inflation was rising rapidly in 1994, and Greenspan raised interest rates seven times in the space of a year, bringing them up to 6%. This was a significant increase, but it did not cause a recession. In fact, the economy continued to grow throughout 1994 and 1995. Why was it successful? Economists will pick three main reasons:\n\n-   First, the economy was strong at the time, which helped to cushion the impact of the higher interest rates.\n-   Second, Greenspan was able to communicate his intentions clearly to the public, which helped to reduce uncertainty.\n-   Third, Greenspan was able to raise interest rates gradually, giving businesses and consumers time to adjust.\n\nIn @fig-5, I plotted this episode and compared it to the current tightening cycle. I also added the \"Hard landing\" of Volcker (which was essentially started by Burns and Miller) and the in-between tightening cycle of 1999 to make the case clearer. Before the 1980s, any comparisons are meaningless, as the Gold Standard was in place, there was a substantially different monetary policy framework, and fiscal dominance was the norm. I also ignored the tightening cycle that preceded the Global Financial Crisis (for obvious reasons) and the tightening cycle of 2018, as it was disrupted by the pandemic.\n\n[^3]: Although, they still care about unemployment to avoid overshooting or undershooting inflation.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Monetary Policy Tightening Cycles](Hawkish_Fed_files/figure-html/fig-5-output-1.png){#fig-5 width=806 height=364}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p></p>\n\n\nSince the introduction of forward guidance and the use of direct communication to influence financial conditions and interest rates, all tightening cycles have followed the same pattern. The Fed begins tightening by communicating its intentions and later by making changes to its balance sheet. The Fed's reaction function under Greenspan and now is quite similar, including making up for Friedman's \"long and variable lags.\" However, unlike in the past, the use of unconventional tools allows the Fed to adjust its policy more smoothly and early on, without raising the policy rate. The three conditions that made Greenspan a legend continue to hold in some reasonable sense. The dynamics are also similar to the tightening cycle of 1999, which ended with the dot-com crash. However, as the \"mini\" banking crash clearly demonstrated, the financial system is much more resilient today. Of course, there are some factors that are different between now and then, such as the starting point and the level of inflation. However, a full assessment of all these factors would require a whole new discussion.\n\nHowever, I believe that luck factors are more important than they were in the past. I call \"luck factors\" the factors that central banks cannot fully control, such as consumer and business behavior. These behaviors are generally stable and predictable, but they can be disrupted by indirect or second-round effects of monetary policy. For example, when interest rates rise, mortgage payments become more expensive, which reduces disposable income. This can lead to slower growth, which in turn can further reduce disposable income. These indirect effects are what make the effects of monetary policy have \"long and variable lags.\" Supply shocks are also \"luck factors,\" as are any other unanticipated events. In addition, a soft landing substantially depends on the pace at which central banks want to bring inflation down. A fast pace implies less chance of a soft landing, as it would require the real economy to be crashed. Too slow also reduces the chance of a soft landing, as there is a high chance that inflation expectations will become de-anchored and new unfavorable shocks will hit the system. \n\nTo conclude, a soft landing is a fine-tuning exercise that is difficult to achieve, almost identical if not as elusive as timing the market. However, for the current tightening cycle, a soft landing is still a highly probable and well-justified outcome. Based on the evidence here, the Fed has taken all necessary steps to achieve this goal and some of the necessary conditions for a soft landing are clearly met.\n\n",
