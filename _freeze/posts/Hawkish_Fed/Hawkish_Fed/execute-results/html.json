Essentially, forward guidance involves the Federal Reserve (or \"the Fed,\" as it's commonly known) communicating its future policy plans to the markets. By shaping expectations and influencing interest rates in this way, the Fed can steer the economy in the desired direction.\n\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, forward guidance became an especially critical tool, as the federal funds rate hit zero. In order to continue to stimulate the economy, the Fed needed to find new tricks or in the words of [Bernanke](https://www.amazon.co.uk/21st-Century-Monetary-Policy-Inflation/dp/1324020466/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=1172080352962224&hvadid=73255235197595&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=4923&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=e&hvtargid=kwd-73255197392577%3Aloc-188&hydadcr=18495_2211395&keywords=21st+century+monetary+policy&qid=1681764141&sr=8-1) ``we had to be creative\". Forward guidance allowed it to do just that. More recently, forward guidance has played an important role in the ongoing debate over inflation. In this post, I would be looking at a few stylized facts about how the Fed uses this tool.\n\nOne approach is to examine the \"proxy rate\" published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which allows us to gauge the Fed's hawkishness over time. This proxy rate combines the policy rate with the interest rate effects of both balance sheet changes and direct communication. You can find more information on the proxy rate [here](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/proxy-funds-rate/) and [here](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2022/november/monetary-policy-stance-is-tighter-than-federal-funds-rate/). In essence, the proxy rate offers a way to compare the Fed's actual policy rate to a hypothetical rate that reflects the total impact of the Fed's actions (intentions) and statements on financial markets.\n\n\n\nI plot these two rates in @fig-1, where the discrepancy between them represents the interest rate equivalent of the forward guidance. It is worth noting that due to the forward guidance and the way monetary policy is conducted (i.e. usually first preparing the markets and then acting) the proxy rate leads the actual policy rate, and this pattern is especially pronounced post-2007.\n\nBefore the global financial crisis, the proxy rate and the fund rate were tightly correlated, until they started to diverge after 2007, when both QE and forward guidance became integral components of the monetary policy framework. During this period, the use of forward guidance amounted to a monetary policy stance of negative interest rates (the intention of QE and forward guidance). These ultra-low interest rates persisted until 2014, when the Fed reversed course.\n\nIn the more recent years, much of the analysis (including that of respected academics) has rushed to the conclusion that the Fed acted with a delay. However, as @fig-1 clearly shows, the Fed began to tighten financial conditions through forward guidance well before the interest rate hikes took place. According to the proxy rate, this tightening began around July 2021, a full eight months prior to the first rate hike in March 2022.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Hawkish_Fed_files/figure-html/fig-1-output-1.png){#fig-1 width=639 height=478}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Forward Guidance Since the Pandemic\n\nIt's worth emphasizing that even prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the proxy rate and the fund rate were not identical. This discrepancy can be attributed to the inevitable measurement errors involved in calculating the proxy rate, as well as the potential impact of Fed officials' speeches, which have historically revealed the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) intentions. Of course, it's impossible to completely eliminate statistical errors. However, we can reasonably assume that most of the difference between the proxy rate and the fund rate can be attributed to communication-related factors.\n\n@fig-2 illustrates the difference between the proxy rate and the fund rate. It reveals the hypothetical level of interest rates that changes in the Fed’s balance sheet and the impact of direct communication have added or subtracted from the official policy rate. For instance, in this monetary policy tightening cycle, at its peak, forward guidance added an extra 3% to the policy rate. This implies that until last October, the economy has effectively functioning at a level of interest rates that is closer to the 6% than the official policy rate of 3%. It was only after Oct 2022 that the Fed turned its policy to a less hawkish stance (so, before the SBV shock). \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Hawkish_Fed_files/figure-html/fig-2-output-1.png){#fig-2 width=639 height=478}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Most Hawkish Fed in the US History\n\nIn conclusion, let me offer some final thoughts on forward guidance and explain why the Fed’s current stance is its most hawkish since the 1970s. @fig-3 below shows the standardized distribution of the forward guidance measure - that is, the z-score of the distance between the proxy rate and fund rate. This metric allows us to compare the current stance with historical averages in a more consistent manner. A positive z-score signifies a hawkish stance, while a negative z-score indicates a dovish stance.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Hawkish_Fed_files/figure-html/fig-3-output-1.png){#fig-3 width=659 height=470}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe distribution of forward guidance across different decades offers some intriguing insights. During the 1970s, the Fed’s communication was more often dovish than hawkish - a situation that may have contributed to the runaway inflation of that period. This perception persisted into the next decade until Volcker changed it. Since 2000, when forward guidance became an integral part of the Fed’s policy framework, we have seen improved communication from the Fed and a symmetrical effect on markets.\n\nIn the post-pandemic period, the Fed has evidently turned hawkish to combat inflation, as reflected in both its forward guidance and the proxy rate. Until now, much market commentary has accused the Fed of doing too little, yet the present evidence contradicts this false perception. According to Figure 4, the Fed’s forward guidance has resulted in the largest increase in interest rates in the last 50 years - even greater than during Volcker’s era. Currently, the proxy rate is falling, suggesting that the Fed has already softened its stance (though still hawkish) since February 2023 - well before the recent shock in the banking sector. \n\n::: {#fig-4 .cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {#fig-4-1 .cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n```\n<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7ff240dbba00>\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Hawkish_Fed_files/figure-html/fig-4-output-2.png){#fig-4-2 width=658 height=478}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
