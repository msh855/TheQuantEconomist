This is a method used by central banks to directly communicate or signal their intentions in order to shape expectations and influence interest rates in the desired direction. During the 2008 financial crisis, forward guidance became an especially critical tool, as the policy rate hit zero. In order to continue stimulating the economy, the Federal Reserve (Fed) needed to find new ways to do so. As Ben [Bernanke](https://www.amazon.co.uk/21st-Century-Monetary-Policy-Inflation/dp/1324020466/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=1172080352962224&hvadid=73255235197595&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=4923&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=e&hvtargid=kwd-73255197392577%3Aloc-188&hydadcr=18495_2211395&keywords=21st+century+monetary+policy&qid=1681764141&sr=8-1) put it, \"we had to be creative.\" Forward guidance allowed the Fed to do just that. More recently, forward guidance has played an important role in the ongoing debate over inflation. In this post, I will be looking at a few stylized facts about how the Fed uses this tool.\n\nOne way to measure the Fed's forward guidance is to look at the \"proxy rate,\" which is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (See [here](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/proxy-funds-rate/) and [here](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2022/november/monetary-policy-stance-is-tighter-than-federal-funds-rate/)). The proxy rate combines the Fed's policy rate with the level of interest rate implied by the balance sheet changes and direct communication. The proxy rate can be used to compare the Fed's actual policy rate to a hypothetical rate that reflects the total impact of the Fed's actions and statements on financial markets.\n\n\n\nI have plotted the proxy and policy rate in @fig-1 below. It is important to note that the proxy rate leads the actual policy rate because of the way monetary policy is implemented. Typically, the markets are set up in anticipation of a change in the policy rate before the change actually takes place. This pattern is (unsurprisingly) pronounced after 2007.\n\nBefore the global financial crisis, the proxy rate and the fund rate were closely correlated. However, they started to diverge after 2007, when quantitative easing (QE) and forward guidance became integral components of the monetary policy framework. During this period, the use of forward guidance amounted to a monetary policy stance of negative interest rates (validating the purpose that it was designed). These ultra-low interest rates persisted until 2014, when the Fed started to actually reverse its course, according to the proxy rate.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![The Proxy and Policy Rate](Hawkish_Fed_files/figure-html/fig-1-output-1.png){#fig-1 width=639 height=478}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt's worth emphasizing that even prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the proxy rate and the fund rate were not identical. Part of this discrepancy can be attributed to the inevitable measurement errors involved in calculating a statistical measure such as the proxy rate. Of course, it's impossible to completely eliminate statistical errors, but we can reasonably assume that most of the difference between the proxy rate and the fund rate can be attributed to communication-related factors.\n\n\n## The Most Hawkish Fed in the US History\n\nThe difference between the proxy and policy rate shows the level of interest rate implied by the Fed's forward guidance. @fig-2 shows exactly this. For example, at the peak of its hawkishness during this monetary policy tightening cycle, the Fed added an extra 3% to the policy rate by just pointing what will be doing. This means that until October 2022, the economy was effectively operating at an interest rate level closer to 6% than the official policy rate of 3%. It was only after October 2022 that the Fed turned less hawkish. \n\nIn recent years, many people (including respected [academics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/CFM/assets/pdf/CFM-Discussion-Papers-2022/CFMDP2022-09-Paper.pdf)) have criticized the Fed for acting too slowly to address the rising inflation. However, according to this evidence, the Fed began to tighten financial conditions through forward guidance well before the interest rate hikes took place. In fact, the actual tightening began eight months before the first rate hike in March 2022, and almost a year and a half after the pandemic shock. Note that when the Fed changed its tone (i.e. the actual starting point of the tightening cycle), inflation was mostly [driven by supply-side factors](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/supply-and-demand-driven-pce-inflation/), such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. As a result, there was less room for monetary policy to do much. However, the Fed clearly began to change course before the pressure from the demand side on inflation started to pick up.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Forward Guidance: Interest rate equivalence](Hawkish_Fed_files/figure-html/fig-2-output-1.png){#fig-2 width=639 height=478}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet me end this post by explaining why the evidence here shows that the Fed's current stance is the most hawkish since the 1970s. @fig-3 below shows the standardized distribution of the forward guidance measure for each decade. This metric, which is the z-score of the distance between the proxy rate and the fund rate, allows us to compare the current stance with historical averages in a more consistent manner. A positive z-score indicates a hawkish stance, while a negative z-score indicates a dovish stance.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Forward Communication across decades](Hawkish_Fed_files/figure-html/fig-3-output-1.png){#fig-3 width=659 height=470}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, the distribution is skewed to the left, suggesting that the Fed's communication was more often dovish than hawkish - a situation that may have contributed to the runaway inflation of that period. This perception persisted into the next decade until Volcker changed it. Since 2000, when forward guidance became an integral part of the Fed's policy framework, we have seen improved communication from the Fed and a more even and symmetrical effect on markets.\n\nWhat is interesting is that in recent years, when the Fed had to fight the largest increase in inflation since the 1970s, its tone changed to an equally extreme level. In fact, the evidence suggests that the degree of hawkishness, as measured by the effects of its direct communication, was the largest in history. Add to this the fact that the policy rate already implies an equally [large effect on output](https://msh855.github.io/TheQuantEconomist/posts/fed_and_private_consumption/the_fed_and_private_consumption.html) and moved at the fastest pace in US history, then there is only one conclusion we can make: we are currently witnessing the most hawkish monetary policy stance in modern US history, and its effects are just starting to emerge.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Forward Guidance deviations from the mean (zcore)](Hawkish_Fed_files/figure-html/fig-4-output-1.png){#fig-4 width=658 height=478}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
