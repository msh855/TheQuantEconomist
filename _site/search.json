    "text": "The war in Ukraine has raised significantly the odds of a recession in the near term, but also the likelihood to move into a new inflation regime as in the 70s. How real this risk is depends on the key differentiating factors between now and then.\nIn a nutshell, textbooks would tell that a sequence of oil crises (rooted, like now, in geopolitical factors) permanently increased the cost of production for firms and, by extension, the cost of goods and services. This subsequently triggered a wage-price spiral (as households were trying to catch up with rising prices) which led to ever-increasing inflation. Such past experience places a material probability that a similar mechanism triggered by the same factors (oil shock and high inflation) might re-emerge with the Fed or all other major central banks unable to control inflation.\nA closer look, however, at the underlying factors that underpinned the mechanism behind this wage-price spiral would suggest that this time is different. In short, the structurally weaker bargaining power of workers and its dependency on the economic cycle is effectively putting an upper limit to any catch-up of wages with extreme inflation. The direct implication of this key differentiating factor alone is that a) any wage-price spiral is likely to be short-lived relative to the 70s, especially when growth would start to slow down and b) the cost-push shocks are unlikely to turn into permanent supply shocks as then.\nIn the rest of this post, I will mostly focus on discussing this argument in more detail, along with a few other, more known, key dissimilarities between then and now. In my mind, I have mostly the US economy, but some of the arguments are relevant for other countries, too.\n\n\nOne obvious difference between now and then, is that this wage-price spiral that unfolded during the 70s was heavily relying on the structurally strong bargaining power of workers that is absent today. Workers at the time were unionised and their bargaining power did not necessarily depend on the tightness of the labor market or the state of the economy as now. Currently, a recession or a slow down in economic activity (either due to monetary policy tightening or a negative shock such as now with oil prices) is almost automatically reducing the bargaining power of most workers, and this in a fashion that nominal wages might not necessarily catch-up with inflation without legislation.\nAn exception here might be the high-income high-skilled households who nevertheless tend to consume less energy-intensive products (with declining overtime cost of production due to technological advancements) while their high marginal propensity to save diminishes the strength of aggregate demand on prices (formally flattening of the Philips Curve). This also highlights that in the absence of trade unions the degree of (wage or income) inequalities is another confounding factor that stops wages from catching up with inflation and implies that, on the aggregate, real wages most likely would fall. This effect in turn can help offset the (often reversible) production costs due to higher energy prices and help prevent the cost-push shocks to turn permanent.\nPut more simply, the structurally weaker bargaining position of workers in effect implies that any temporary cost-push shocks are less likely to manifest themselves into the permanent supply shock of the 70s, especially since oil is now a less important input to the production compared to the past.\nNew modes of work arrangements and the ability of multinationals to either outsource or reallocate abroad (expensive) labour-intensive functions are two other factors that can reduce the persistence of cost-push shocks. For example, competition might force firms to contain their labour costs and among the available options they have is to offer indefinite work-from-home arrangements. This new mode of working could lift some of the pressure for workers to catch up with inflation when they are given the option to indefinitely move to less expensive regions. On the other hand, multinationals might choose to react more aggressively if they think their profitability is severely distressed. For example, they could choose to outsource some of their labour intensive high-skill functions or reallocate their workers abroad. Given their size in the economy and the limited availability of quality jobs for high-skilled workers in advanced economies, this might further reduce the bargaining power of workers when economic growth slows down.\n\n\n\nSecondly, the world now is structurally very different from the 70s. We live in a world where the global economy (perhaps the first time in its history) is producing an excess amount of savings with record low real investments. With governments around the world having not really solved this problem it is extremely unlikely to see any change of this structural issue in the foreseeable future. This dearth of investments contains, therefore, a very strong deflationary process that was totally absent during the 70s.\nThe forced coordination across countries in transitioning to net-zero or now the accidental coordination to increase defence spending (with little to no influence on r*, natural interest rate) is unlikely to outweigh the strong incentives to save from demographics, higher inequalities, structurally weaker labour markets in combination with a weaker welfare state, and governmental or private market schemes, such as private pension schemes or other unfunded social security programmes — that typically raise the incentives to save but at the cost of depressed returns on capital and higher financial risk, hence further reinforcing the incentive to save to reach target wealth levels by retirement which further depress returns and so on (“savings trap”). By now, we know by experience that in this world financial markets have a stronger incentive to keep most of the liquidity in the financial system (in search of yield) rather than finance real investments that depend on a very weak long-term growth outlook.\n\n\n\nThere are a few other more nuanced differentiating factors that are worth highlighting here. First, the degree of financialisation together with the prevalence of idiosyncratic financial risks to households unveil other strong deflationary forces.\nFor households, is safe to assume that it is more challenging now to insure against the risk of employment, career and job displacement risks, health shocks etc. So, the most important insurance mechanism against bad outcomes is to build up buffers of savings and more wealth. Such a precautionary savings motive might be stronger today than in the past for a number of reasons:\n\nMuch weaker welfare states and employment protection that increase the severity of possible negative income shocks (which academic economists showed also explain the skewness of, much more uneven today, wealth distribution )\nMore leveraged households are extremely susceptible to negative wealth shocks mainly due to the housing market\nMore individualistic societies that make people rely more on their own feet than expect the help of others. Having money and building up wealth becomes then a high order priority for most households to survive any adverse outcome or to increase their quality of life.\n\nSecond, the degree of financialisation, as is captured by what economists might call market incompleteness, has increased since the 70s due to the liberalisation of capital flows and the availability of more hedging instruments. Now, the degree by which investors can hedge against risks is substantially greater today than before. In a world in which liquidity is abundant, this reinforces the incentives of the financial system to allocate more money into (risky) financial assets rather finance real investments (which as said before rely on a weak long-term growth outlook).\n\n\n\nAlthough this analysis is anything but comprehensive and the future is always uncertain, I highlighted here a few crucial differentiating factors that play a dominant role in most economies today and are important for the inflation regime. The deflationary forces from the structurally weaker labour force not only is putting an upper limit to the wage-price spiral (that is central to many peoples’ arguments for inflation to go out of hand) but also limits the extent by which a cost-push shock can turn into a permanent supply shock. This, together with the legacies from the “excess savings world”, unleash a strong deflationary process that can only be reversed by either a serious escalation in the war in Ukraine (a largely unpredictable factor) or by some serious policy mistake from now on.\nAll these suugest that the Fed can still control inflation, albeit at the cost of a recession or a slow down in the near term economic growth. In addition, the structural characteristics in the labour markets also imply that the deflationary process might be asymmetric and more unsynchronised across countries (i.e. the opposite case with the existing inflation dynamics).\nFor Eurozone countries, which also inherit other critical similarities with the 70s such as the “fixed exchange rate” regime, rising public debt, and current account imbalances, as well as they feature higher sensitivity to oil prices, inflation might become a source of a new political conflict due to ECB’s hawkish turn. This adds a greater uncertainty in Eurozone countries around the long-term inflation outlook and does not rule out the possibility that some countries might indeed experience a relatively long stagflationary period given the asymmetric (recessionary) implications of the ECB, their different structural characteristics, and the imperfect political and fiscal union."

    "text": "Welcome to my blog!\nThe only important information you really need to know about me is that I grew up in the beautiful Meteora.\nOther than this, my boring bio accumulates roughly 10 years of experience as a macroeconomist, mainly working in policy-making, economic research, and academia. Please have a look at my Linkedin profile if you are interested in my “CV”.\nAcademically, I specialize in Fiscal Policy, Macroeconomic Theory, and Computational Economics. I have worked in the applications of General Equilibrium with Incomplete Asset Markets, and as an economist I am strongly influenced by the works of Peter Diamond, T. Sargent, and O. Blanchard. The combined influences of their work on my research helped me to build a solid knowledge around fiscal policy, public debt, and macroeconomic and finance theory.\nComputational Economics came as a byproduct of my research. I ended up discovering that I enjoy coding, programming and got reasonably good at it. I developed own ways of solving stochastic macroeconomic models with large state-space. Because of this strand of research, I later on discovered Machine Learning as it was related to some of the stuff I was working (See here for what I mean).\n\nSince I cannot separate my quant and economist side, I decided to name this blog “The Quant Economist”, but I mainly aim to write (infrequently) about macroeconomic and finance related topics, and applied data science material. I believe that evidence based economics is pretty much data science, and data science is a good tool for better economics. Not to mention that data science (or Machine Learning) is the new econometrics. So, whenever I post about some applied data science material this is mostly to promote some good use-cases in macroeconomics or finance.\nAh, one final plead. I encourage you to call me Safis. This is my nickname name and how my family and friends call me.\nI hope you enjoy the content here.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n Disclaimer: None of the information presented anywhere on this site should be inferred as an investment advice or be considered that is related directly or indirectly to any other author’s related functions.
