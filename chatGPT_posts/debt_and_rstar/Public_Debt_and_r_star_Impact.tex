\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This document discusses how public debt dynamics influence r-star, the
natural rate of interest. We explore the key transmission channels
through which public debt affects r-star and highlight the critical role
of the sustainability condition in stabilizing r-star and long-term
interest rates.

\subsection{1. Debt Sustainability and Interest
Rates}\label{debt-sustainability-and-interest-rates}

The idea behind debt sustainability is to ensure that a government's
debt does not grow faster than its ability to pay it back, which is
essentially its economic output (GDP). If debt grows too fast relative
to GDP, it could become unsustainable, leading to difficulties in
servicing the debt, potentially causing higher interest rates or even
default.

\subsubsection{1.1 Key Terms}\label{key-terms}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Debt-to-Output Ratio}: The ratio of the government's debt to
  the country's GDP, often denoted as:

  {[} d\_t = \frac{D_t}{Y_t} {]}

  where:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    (d\_t) = debt-to-output ratio at time (t),
  \item
    (D\_t) = nominal debt at time (t),
  \item
    (Y\_t) = nominal GDP at time (t).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Real Interest Rate (r)}: The interest rate on debt adjusted
  for inflation, representing the true cost of borrowing.
\item
  \textbf{GDP Growth Rate (g)}: The rate at which the economy is growing
  in real terms (adjusted for inflation).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{1.2 The Sustainability Condition
Formula}\label{the-sustainability-condition-formula}

The sustainability condition says that for the debt-to-GDP ratio to
remain stable or decrease, the growth rate of the debt must be lower
than the difference between the real interest rate (r) and the growth
rate of the economy (g). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

{[} \Delta d\_t \leq (r - g) d\_\{t-1\} {]}

If (r \textgreater{} g), the debt is growing faster than the economy,
and for sustainability, the government needs to run \textbf{primary
surpluses} (where revenue exceeds non-interest expenditures) to offset
this growth.

\subsection{2. Link to Long-Term Interest
Rates}\label{link-to-long-term-interest-rates}

The sustainability condition places a limit on how much debt a
government can issue without triggering a rise in interest rates. If the
condition is met, debt grows at a manageable pace relative to GDP,
keeping investor confidence high and risk premiums low, thereby
preventing a spike in long-term interest rates.

\subsubsection{2.1 Market Perception of Default Risk and
Confidence}\label{market-perception-of-default-risk-and-confidence}

Financial markets closely watch the debt-to-GDP ratio and the trajectory
of debt growth. If debt is perceived as sustainable (r - g \textless{}
0), markets remain confident in the government's ability to pay back
debt, keeping long-term interest rates low.

\subsubsection{2.2 Crowding Out and Private
Investment}\label{crowding-out-and-private-investment}

High public debt can crowd out private investment by pushing up interest
rates, as the government competes for funds in financial markets.
Conversely, if debt is sustainable, this crowding-out effect is
minimized, and r-star remains closer to its fundamental drivers.

\subsection{3. How Debt Sustainability Affects
r-star}\label{how-debt-sustainability-affects-r-star}

Public debt dynamics influence r-star through several channels. Here's
how the sustainability condition, public debt levels, and their impact
on long-term interest rates link back to r-star:

\subsubsection{3.1 Risk Premium and
r-star}\label{risk-premium-and-r-star}

When a government's debt is perceived as sustainable, risk premiums
remain low, preventing long-term interest rates from rising. If public
debt becomes unsustainable, risk premiums increase, pushing up both
long-term interest rates and r-star.

\subsubsection{3.2 Crowding Out Effect on
r-star}\label{crowding-out-effect-on-r-star}

If high debt crowds out private investment, the equilibrium interest
rate (r-star) rises. If debt is perceived as sustainable, the
crowding-out effect is minimized.

\subsubsection{3.3 Expectations of Fiscal Policy and Savings
Behavior}\label{expectations-of-fiscal-policy-and-savings-behavior}

When debt is sustainable, confidence in fiscal stability remains intact,
minimizing precautionary savings. This balance between savings and
investment helps keep r-star aligned with economic fundamentals.

\subsubsection{3.4 Fiscal Policy and
r-star}\label{fiscal-policy-and-r-star}

Debt sustainability allows active fiscal policy to stabilize the
economy, which can smooth fluctuations in r-star over time.
Unsustainable debt limits fiscal policy options, potentially lowering
r-star.

\subsubsection{3.5 Global Capital Flows and
r-star}\label{global-capital-flows-and-r-star}

High public debt in a major economy can influence global capital flows.
If perceived as risky, this raises global interest rates, influencing
r-star in other economies.

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Debt sustainability is crucial for stabilizing r-star. When the
sustainability condition (r - g \textless{} 0) is met, debt levels are
managed relative to GDP, preventing an undue rise in long-term interest
rates. This ensures that r-star remains aligned with economic
fundamentals, supporting balanced growth and economic stability.
