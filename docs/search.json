    "text": "UK’s budget is a bet that inflation is transitory and is designed in keeping Tories in power.\n\n\n\n\nToday is Budget Day, and besides my congratulations to my ex-colleagues for their hard work in the background, I have a few quick reactions.\nToday’s Budget was an off-the-shelf, “play it safe” budget from Sunak. It was nothing too negative, but also nothing too positive. The budget balanced political and economic risks in the short run, reduced debt (mostly after the planned elections in two years), and made sure it met the OBR’s forecasts on paper rather than in reality.\nUnfortunately, there was minimal support for long-term growth and potential output. This has a deflationary impact over time, which makes it easier for people to get cheaper mortgages. To be fair, no political party has a serious structural reform agenda.\nThe distributional implications of the budget will be subject to debate. According to the OBR, inflation has wiped out eight years of real wage growth for most households in the UK in just two years. After the budget, most vulnerable people will still see their real wages falling.\nThe overall fiscal stance is mostly tuned to the expected peak in inflation, pushing back actual austerity after the elections. In general, it’s not easy to tackle inflation through fiscal policy, but blind austerity is also not the answer. I will try to come back with a more detailed post in due time. The key point is that fiscal policy is much more likely to have a higher impact on output than reduce inflation via aggregate demand. Letting the Bank of England lead the fight against inflation and doing the minimum by not adding fuel to the fire makes sense. The budget delivers such ideas.\nHunt also mentioned that inflation is mostly driven by global factors. Although this is correct, I think it rather exposes the government with a very late and a poor implantation of a price cap policy. Why is price capping an optimal response to rising inflation due to global factors? Besides the obvious protection it provides to households, energy price caps are equivalent to closing the borders to a widespread global virus. Price caps effectively convert a supply-side problem to a demand problem and increase the relative importance of domestic to global factors. Together, this implies that national governments and central banks can have greater control over inflation and thus contribute to a less uncertain outlook.\nPrice caps were introduced quite late and with no clear plan on what to do next. They seemed to be conditioned on market expectations. It’s important to remember that when governments in the past have had to manage similar inflation problems, inflation jumped once the price caps were lifted. Keeping inflation on a durable and, more importantly, a more certain falling path required price caps to be imposed much sooner with a clearer plan, ideally linked to the overall risks in the global and domestic economy, rather than accepting the wishful thinking in the markets."

    "text": "The war in Ukraine has raised significantly the odds of a recession in the near term, but also the likelihood to move into a new inflation regime as in the 70s. How real this risk is, depends on the key differentiating factors between now and then.\nIn a nutshell, textbooks would tell that a sequence of oil crises (rooted, like now, in geopolitical factors) permanently increased the cost of production for firms and, by extension, the cost of goods and services. This subsequently triggered a wage-price spiral (as households were trying to catch up with rising prices) which led to ever-increasing inflation. Such past experience places a material probability that a similar mechanism triggered by the same factors (oil shock and high inflation) might re-emerge with the Fed or all other major central banks unable to control inflation.\nA closer look, however, at the underlying factors that underpinned the mechanism behind this wage-price spiral would suggest that this time is different. In short, the structurally weaker bargaining power of workers and its dependency on the economic cycle is effectively putting an upper limit to any catch-up of wages with extreme inflation. The direct implication of this key differentiating factor alone is that a) any wage-price spiral is likely to be short-lived relative to the 70s, especially when growth would start to slow down and b) the cost-push shocks are unlikely to turn into permanent supply shocks as then.\nIn the rest of this post, I will mostly focus on discussing this argument in more detail, along with a few other, more known, key dissimilarities between then and now. In my mind, I have mostly the US economy, but some of the arguments are relevant to other countries, too.\n\n\nOne obvious difference between now and then, is that this wage-price spiral that unfolded during the 70s was heavily relying on the structurally strong bargaining power of workers that is absent today. Workers at the time were unionised and their bargaining power did not necessarily depend on the tightness of the labour market or the state of the economy as now. Currently, a recession or a slowdown in economic activity (either due to monetary policy tightening or a negative shock such as now with oil prices) is almost automatically reducing the bargaining power of most workers, and this in a fashion that nominal wages might not necessarily catch-up with inflation without legislation.\nAn exception here might be the high-income high-skilled households who nevertheless tend to consume less energy-intensive products (with declining overtime cost of production due to technological advancements) while their high marginal propensity to save diminishes the strength of aggregate demand on prices (formally flattening of the Philips Curve). This also highlights that in the absence of trade unions the degree of (wage or income) inequalities is another confounding factor that stops wages from catching up with inflation and implies that, on the aggregate, real wages most likely would fall. This effect in turn can help offset the (often reversible) production costs due to higher energy prices and help prevent the cost-push shocks to turn permanent.\nPut more simply, the structurally weaker bargaining position of workers in effect implies that any temporary cost-push shocks are less likely to manifest themselves into the permanent supply shock of the 70s, especially since oil is now a less important input to production compared to the past.\nNew modes of work arrangements and the ability of multinationals to either outsource or reallocate abroad (expensive) labour-intensive functions are two other factors that can reduce the persistence of cost-push shocks. For example, competition might force firms to contain their labour costs and among the available options they have is to offer indefinite work-from-home arrangements. This new mode of working could lift some of the pressure for workers to catch up with inflation when they are given the option to indefinitely move to less expensive regions. On the other hand, multinationals might choose to react more aggressively if they think their profitability is severely distressed. For example, they could choose to outsource some of their labour-intensive high-skill functions or reallocate their workers abroad. Given their size in the economy and the limited availability of quality jobs for high-skilled workers in advanced economies, this might further reduce the bargaining power of workers when economic growth slows down.\n\n\n\nSecondly, the world now is structurally very different from the 70s. We live in a world where the global economy (perhaps for the first time in its history) is producing an excess amount of savings with record-low real investments. With governments around the world not really solving this problem, it is extremely unlikely to see any change in this structural issue in the foreseeable future. This dearth of investments contains, therefore, a very strong deflationary process that was totally absent during the 70s.\nThe forced coordination across countries in transitioning to net-zero or now the accidental coordination to increase defence spending (with little to no influence on r*, natural interest rate) is unlikely to outweigh the strong incentives to save from demographics, higher inequalities, structural weaker labour markets in combination with a weaker welfare state, and governmental or private market schemes, such as private pension schemes or other unfunded social security programs — that typically raise the incentives to save but at the cost of depressed returns on capital and higher financial risk, hence further reinforcing the incentive to save to reach target wealth levels by retirement which further depress returns and so on (“savings trap”). By now, we know by experience that in this world financial markets have a stronger incentive to keep most of the liquidity in the financial system (in search of yield) rather than finance real investments that depend on a very weak long-term growth outlook.\n\n\n\nThere are a few other more nuanced differentiating factors that are worth highlighting here. First, the degree of financialization together with the prevalence of idiosyncratic financial risks to households unveils other strong deflationary forces.\nFor households, is safe to assume that it is more challenging now to insure against the risk of employment, career and job displacement risks, health shocks etc. So, the most important insurance mechanism against bad outcomes is to build up buffers of savings and more wealth. Such a precautionary savings motive might be stronger today than in the past for a number of reasons:\n\nMuch weaker welfare states and employment protection that increase the severity of possible negative income shocks (which academic economists showed also explain the skewness of, much more uneven today, wealth distribution )\nMore leveraged households are extremely susceptible to negative wealth shocks mainly due to the housing market\nMore individualistic societies that make people rely more on their own feet than expect the help of others. Having money and building up wealth becomes then a high-order priority for most households to survive any adverse outcome or to increase their quality of life.\n\nSecond, the degree of financialization, as is captured by what economists might call market incompleteness, has increased since the 70s due to the liberalisation of capital flows and the availability of more hedging instruments. Now, the degree by which investors can hedge against risks is substantially greater today than before. In a world in which liquidity is abundant, this reinforces the incentives of the financial system to allocate more money into (risky) financial assets rather finance real investments (which as said before rely on a weak long-term growth outlook).\n\n\n\nAlthough this analysis is anything but comprehensive and the future is always uncertain, I highlighted here a few crucial differentiating factors that play a dominant role in most economies today and are important for the inflation regime. The deflationary forces from the structurally weaker labour force not only put an upper limit to the wage-price spiral (that is central to many peoples’ arguments for inflation to go out of hand) but also limit the extent by which a cost-push shock can turn into a permanent supply shock. This, together with the legacies from the “excess savings world”, unleashes a strong deflationary process that can only be reversed by either a serious escalation in the war in Ukraine (a largely unpredictable factor) or by some serious policy mistake from now on.\nAll these suggest that the Fed can still control inflation, albeit at the cost of a recession or slow economic growth in the near term. In addition, the structural characteristics in the labour markets also imply that the deflationary process might be asymmetric and less synchronised across countries (i.e. the opposite case with the existing inflation dynamics).\nFor Eurozone countries, which also inherit other critical similarities with the 70s such as the “fixed exchange rate” regime, rising public debt, and current account imbalances, as well as, feature higher sensitivity to oil prices, inflation might become a source of a new political conflict due to ECB’s hawkish turn. This adds a greater uncertainty in Eurozone countries around the long-term inflation outlook and does not rule out the possibility that some countries might indeed experience relatively long stagflation given the ECB’s asymmetric (recessionary) implications and their different structural characteristics, and the imperfect political and fiscal union."

    "text": "Welcome to my blog!\nThe only important information you really need to know about me is that I grew up in the beautiful Meteora. The rest is self-promotion :)\nI have over 10 years of experience as an economist and in macroeconomic research, mainly working in academic and policy-making and economic research institutes. During this time, I developed strong knowledge of the US and UK economies, and to a lesser extent the Eurozone. Academically, I specialize in fiscal policy, macroeconomic theory, computational economics, and to a lesser extent asset pricing and financial theory.\nOutside academia, I also had the opportunity to work as a data scientist, which gave me a good understanding of the machine learning ecosystem and its applications. At heart and by training, I remain a macroeconomist, and I am fortunate to have developed a strong quantitative and mathematical background during my years of study and research. This has allowed me to approach problems with a great deal of flexibility but also made me a kind of polymath across different disciplines. My (unusual) career path is a reflection of this.\nFriends would describe me as thoughtful. That is because they have see me enjoying debunking economic theories and ideas with solid academic theory or my own reflections and predictions.\nI intend to share my knowledge and curiosity about macroeconomic and financial issues in this blog. I will draw on my experiences and knowledge from academia, policy making, and portfolio management (trading) to write about these topics. I may also post other topics of general interest.\nI’m always happy to connect with new people.
